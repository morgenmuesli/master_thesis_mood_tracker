CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

<h2><b>Note</b></h2>
Due to its many features <i>Mood Patterns</i> is NOT the simplest mood tracker. It probably will take you a few minutes until you know your way around the app. But we try our hardest to make it worth your while with helpful, detailed, and multifaceted insights. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask them at contact@moodpatterns.info or our FB page (link in the app).

 <h1><b>Details</b></h1>
<h2><b>Gain insights into your feelings</b></h2>
A mood journal or mood diary is a great way to keep a record of your feelings, but <i>Mood Patterns</i> can do much more for you. It is not just a mood tracker but links how you feel, to your location, company, and activity as well as to how you slept and to recent events in your life. Use it to explore the patterns in your mood.

<h2><b>Capture how you feel in your daily life</b></h2>
Classical diaries have one major flaw - they are subject to recall bias. Some activities in our lives are more salient than others. We remember them better and more vividly and therefore often believe they take a larger part of each day than they do. However, for most of us, routines fill the largest part of our daily life, and those are often overlooked in diaries. 

To capture all parts of your life that matter <i>Mood Patterns</i> uses a technique of the social sciences: <b>ecological momentary assessment</b> also known as <b>experience sampling</b>.

<h2><b>You are unique</b></h2>
Where we go, who we meet, and what we do is individual. With <i>Mood Patterns</i>, you do not have to choose from a fixed set of categories but can tailor your options to your personal needs. Be as nuanced as you like in configuring places, people, and activities.

<h2><b>Your data is yours</b></h2>
How you feel is sensitive private data. We believe it should not be carelessly entrusted to anybody. <i>Mood Patterns</i>  <b>does not request Internet permission</b>, therefore no data transfer in the background without your knowledge is possible. <i>Mood Patterns</i> will not send us or anybody else your data.

<h2><b>Your data is safe</b></h2>
Denying <i>Mood Patterns</i> Internet access frees you from the need to trust us, but what about others? An <b>app lock</b> assures that only you can use your <i>Mood Patterns</i> app. To prevent that the app lock is bypassed by connecting your mobile phone to a PC, all data is <b>256-bit AES encrypted</b>. Unfortunately, there is no 100% safety, but Mood Patterns makes it hard to get your data without your consent.","<h1><b>Overview</b></h1><br><h2><b>General Features</b></h2><br>* usable as a mood tracker, mood diary, and mood journal<br>* further application fields: symptom tracker and sleep journal<br>* avoid recall bias with experience sampling<br>* as many surveys per day as you like<br>* 30 predefined mood scales<br>* 30 fully customizable scales<br>* customizable additionally data:<br> - places<br> - people<br> - activities<br> - factors<br> - sleep<br> - events<br> - phone usage<br>* set alerts to be notified if your mood level or variation changes<br>* get associations between mood and additional data<br>* explore mood before and after an event<br>* surveys can include notes<br>* markdown formatting of notes<br>* see data in beautiful, zoomable graphs<br>* export graphs<br>* export data <br>* light and dark theme<br><br><h2><b>Security Features</b></h2><br>* NO internet connection<br>* App lock (with fingerprint)<br>* encryption of stored data<br><br><h2><b>Note</b></h2><br>Due to its many features <i>Mood Patterns</i> is NOT the simplest mood tracker.

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

<h2><b>Security Features</b></h2>
* NO internet connection

<h2><b>Note</b></h2>
Due to its many features <i>Mood Patterns</i> is NOT the simplest mood tracker. It probably will take you a few minutes until you know your way around the app. But we try our hardest to make it worth your while with helpful, detailed, and multifaceted insights. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask them at contact@moodpatterns.info or our FB page (link in the app).

 <h1><b>Details</b></h1>
<h2><b>Gain insights into your feelings</b></h2>
A mood journal or mood diary is a great way to keep a record of your feelings, but <i>Mood Patterns</i> can do much more for you. It is not just a mood tracker but links how you feel, to your location, company, and activity as well as to how you slept and to recent events in your life. Use it to explore the patterns in your mood.

<h2><b>Capture how you feel in your daily life</b></h2>
Classical diaries have one major flaw - they are subject to recall bias. Some activities in our lives are more salient than others. We remember them better and more vividly and therefore often believe they take a larger part of each day than they do. However, for most of us, routines fill the largest part of our daily life, and those are often overlooked in diaries. 

To capture all parts of your life that matter <i>Mood Patterns</i> uses a technique of the social sciences: <b>ecological momentary assessment</b> also known as <b>experience sampling</b>.

<h2><b>You are unique</b></h2>
Where we go, who we meet, and what we do is individual. With <i>Mood Patterns</i>, you do not have to choose from a fixed set of categories but can tailor your options to your personal needs. Be as nuanced as you like in configuring places, people, and activities.

<h2><b>Your data is yours</b></h2>
How you feel is sensitive private data. We believe it should not be carelessly entrusted to anybody. <i>Mood Patterns</i>  <b>does not request Internet permission</b>, therefore no data transfer in the background without your knowledge is possible. <i>Mood Patterns</i> will not send us or anybody else your data.

<h2><b>Your data is safe</b></h2>
Denying <i>Mood Patterns</i> Internet access frees you from the need to trust us, but what about others? An <b>app lock</b> assures that only you can use your <i>Mood Patterns</i> app. To prevent that the app lock is bypassed by connecting your mobile phone to a PC, all data is <b>256-bit AES encrypted</b>. Unfortunately, there is no 100% safety, but Mood Patterns makes it hard to get your data without your consent.","<h1><b>Overview</b></h1><br><h2><b>General Features</b></h2><br>* usable as a mood tracker, mood diary, and mood journal<br>* further application fields: symptom tracker and sleep journal<br>* avoid recall bias with experience sampling<br>* as many surveys per day as you like<br>* 30 predefined mood scales<br>* 30 fully customizable scales<br>* customizable additionally data:<br> - places<br> - people<br> - activities<br> - factors<br> - sleep<br> - events<br> - phone usage<br>* set alerts to be notified if your mood level or variation changes<br>* get associations between mood and additional data<br>* explore mood before and after an event<br>* surveys can include notes<br>* markdown formatting of notes<br>* see data in beautiful, zoomable graphs<br>* export graphs<br>* export data <br>* light and dark theme<br><br><h2><b>Security Features</b></h2><br>* NO internet connection<br>* App lock (with fingerprint)<br>* encryption of stored data<br><br><h2><b>Note</b></h2><br>Due to its many features <i>Mood Patterns</i> is NOT the simplest mood tracker.

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

It probably will take you a few minutes until you know your way around the app. But we try our hardest to make it worth your while with helpful, detailed, and multifaceted insights. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask them at contact@moodpatterns.info or our FB page (link in the app).

 <h1><b>Details</b></h1>
<h2><b>Gain insights into your feelings</b></h2>
A mood journal or mood diary is a great way to keep a record of your feelings, but <i>Mood Patterns</i> can do much more for you. It is not just a mood tracker but links how you feel, to your location, company, and activity as well as to how you slept and to recent events in your life. Use it to explore the patterns in your mood.

<h2><b>Capture how you feel in your daily life</b></h2>
Classical diaries have one major flaw - they are subject to recall bias. Some activities in our lives are more salient than others. We remember them better and more vividly and therefore often believe they take a larger part of each day than they do. However, for most of us, routines fill the largest part of our daily life, and those are often overlooked in diaries. 

To capture all parts of your life that matter <i>Mood Patterns</i> uses a technique of the social sciences: <b>ecological momentary assessment</b> also known as <b>experience sampling</b>.

<h2><b>You are unique</b></h2>
Where we go, who we meet, and what we do is individual. With <i>Mood Patterns</i>, you do not have to choose from a fixed set of categories but can tailor your options to your personal needs. Be as nuanced as you like in configuring places, people, and activities.

<h2><b>Your data is yours</b></h2>
How you feel is sensitive private data. We believe it should not be carelessly entrusted to anybody. <i>Mood Patterns</i>  <b>does not request Internet permission</b>, therefore no data transfer in the background without your knowledge is possible. <i>Mood Patterns</i> will not send us or anybody else your data.

<h2><b>Your data is safe</b></h2>
Denying <i>Mood Patterns</i> Internet access frees you from the need to trust us, but what about others? An <b>app lock</b> assures that only you can use your <i>Mood Patterns</i> app. To prevent that the app lock is bypassed by connecting your mobile phone to a PC, all data is <b>256-bit AES encrypted</b>. Unfortunately, there is no 100% safety, but Mood Patterns makes it hard to get your data without your consent.","<h1><b>Overview</b></h1><br><h2><b>General Features</b></h2><br>* usable as a mood tracker, mood diary, and mood journal<br>* further application fields: symptom tracker and sleep journal<br>* avoid recall bias with experience sampling<br>* as many surveys per day as you like<br>* 30 predefined mood scales<br>* 30 fully customizable scales<br>* customizable additionally data:<br> - places<br> - people<br> - activities<br> - factors<br> - sleep<br> - events<br> - phone usage<br>* set alerts to be notified if your mood level or variation changes<br>* get associations between mood and additional data<br>* explore mood before and after an event<br>* surveys can include notes<br>* markdown formatting of notes<br>* see data in beautiful, zoomable graphs<br>* export graphs<br>* export data <br>* light and dark theme<br><br><h2><b>Security Features</b></h2><br>* NO internet connection<br>* App lock (with fingerprint)<br>* encryption of stored data<br><br><h2><b>Note</b></h2><br>Due to its many features <i>Mood Patterns</i> is NOT the simplest mood tracker.

This is how a CBT-guided diary works. 

<b>Get to know yourself by diving deeply into your passions, feelings, and life goals.</b>

<b>Mental health</b> is a highly complex machine and sometimes it falls into depression. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) journal comes to help through dozens of effective techniques:
- Mindfulness journaling lets you unwind at the end of the day
- Guided reflection improves mindfulness and teach gratitude
- Mood tracker diary allows keeping track of mood dynamics
- Self-care diary serves for learning new ways of thinking and overcoming depression
- Journal itself makes bipolar smoother

<b>Mood tracker diary is here to find out the prerequisites for depression:</b>
- what time of the day causes a bad mood
- particular activities responsible for negative thoughts
- ineffective behavior

Mental health apps are often hired for fast check-in as if it had been any helpful in the therapy. Mind journal app, on the other hand, provides instruments for deep personal transformations as well as anxiety relief.

Guided journal notebook releases a huge amount of positive energy which is hidden by mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. 

<b> Self-care journaling with Mind Journal consists of these components:</b>
- Relax and reflect in the diary
- 3 to 10 logs with the mood tracker to obtain the whole mental health picture and identify bipolar
- Development of happiness by following anxiety relief journal prompts
- Listening of meditation and affirmation for good sleep

Mental health wellbeing requires a daily impact on it. The more your work on reflection habits the more powerful the brain muscles get and the more output you receive in the direction of anxiety relief. 

Destructive factors affect our mind permanently causing bipolar depression or anxiety. An excessive amount of information, lack of self-care culture - all these things influence negatively mental health.

Just when you think you‚Äôve achieved stability, something can throw you completely off, and there you go down the spiral to panic and sadness again. For this reason, keeping a mood journal can be extremely beneficial. 

By keeping a daily log of your emotional temperature, you can start to identify the patterns of behavior and are better equipped to catch a depressive episode before a full-blown relapse happens.

Some benefits of keeping a Mood Journal:
- It helps connect with your feelings.
- It helps process your emotions.
- It helps reset your mood.
- It helps reveal your emotional patterns, triggers, and unresolved emotional issues.
- It helps cultivate inner stability and equanimity.
- It will greatly improve your relationship with yourself and others.
- It keeps a record of your emotional journey.

A mood chart is a chart that has information on your mood, hours of sleep, and medications. Most people use mood charts to understand how their moods fluctuate, and also to recognize the influence of mood on other behaviors, such as sleep, energy, and eating. Charting is the best way to detect mood swings and will give you a tool to use with your doctor to fight disorders, such as bipolar disorder.

Keeping a mood diary can be a valuable component of treatment for psychological disorders including bipolar disorder, major depression, and anxiety. We provide a systematic and portable means of rating mood symptoms over time, and allow the user to better understand how emotional states vary with thoughts, behaviors, and experiences.","Anyone who has suffered from depression, anxiety, or another kind of mood disorder knows how volatile a mood can be.

These challenges have different levels of difficulty and will ensure that you create simple but powerful habits. As some have claimed: <b>""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is therefore not an act, but a habit"".</b>

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

<h2><b>Note</b></h2>
Due to its many features <i>Mood Patterns</i> is NOT the simplest mood tracker. It probably will take you a few minutes until you know your way around the app. But we try our hardest to make it worth your while with helpful, detailed, and multifaceted insights. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask them at contact@moodpatterns.info or our FB page (link in the app).

 <h1><b>Details</b></h1>
<h2><b>Gain insights into your feelings</b></h2>
A mood journal or mood diary is a great way to keep a record of your feelings, but <i>Mood Patterns</i> can do much more for you. It is not just a mood tracker but links how you feel, to your location, company, and activity as well as to how you slept and to recent events in your life. Use it to explore the patterns in your mood.

<h2><b>Capture how you feel in your daily life</b></h2>
Classical diaries have one major flaw - they are subject to recall bias. Some activities in our lives are more salient than others. We remember them better and more vividly and therefore often believe they take a larger part of each day than they do. However, for most of us, routines fill the largest part of our daily life, and those are often overlooked in diaries. 

To capture all parts of your life that matter <i>Mood Patterns</i> uses a technique of the social sciences: <b>ecological momentary assessment</b> also known as <b>experience sampling</b>.

<h2><b>You are unique</b></h2>
Where we go, who we meet, and what we do is individual. With <i>Mood Patterns</i>, you do not have to choose from a fixed set of categories but can tailor your options to your personal needs. Be as nuanced as you like in configuring places, people, and activities.

<h2><b>Your data is yours</b></h2>
How you feel is sensitive private data. We believe it should not be carelessly entrusted to anybody. <i>Mood Patterns</i>  <b>does not request Internet permission</b>, therefore no data transfer in the background without your knowledge is possible. <i>Mood Patterns</i> will not send us or anybody else your data.

<h2><b>Your data is safe</b></h2>
Denying <i>Mood Patterns</i> Internet access frees you from the need to trust us, but what about others? An <b>app lock</b> assures that only you can use your <i>Mood Patterns</i> app. To prevent that the app lock is bypassed by connecting your mobile phone to a PC, all data is <b>256-bit AES encrypted</b>. Unfortunately, there is no 100% safety, but Mood Patterns makes it hard to get your data without your consent.","<h1><b>Overview</b></h1><br><h2><b>General Features</b></h2><br>* usable as a mood tracker, mood diary, and mood journal<br>* further application fields: symptom tracker and sleep journal<br>* avoid recall bias with experience sampling<br>* as many surveys per day as you like<br>* 30 predefined mood scales<br>* 30 fully customizable scales<br>* customizable additionally data:<br> - places<br> - people<br> - activities<br> - factors<br> - sleep<br> - events<br> - phone usage<br>* set alerts to be notified if your mood level or variation changes<br>* get associations between mood and additional data<br>* explore mood before and after an event<br>* surveys can include notes<br>* markdown formatting of notes<br>* see data in beautiful, zoomable graphs<br>* export graphs<br>* export data <br>* light and dark theme<br><br><h2><b>Security Features</b></h2><br>* NO internet connection<br>* App lock (with fingerprint)<br>* encryption of stored data<br><br><h2><b>Note</b></h2><br>Due to its many features <i>Mood Patterns</i> is NOT the simplest mood tracker.

Name it to tame it, track emotion reactions, triggers, secondary emotions, and your emotion reaction and mood comments. Find patterns in your moods and triggers that affect your emotions to improve your overall good feelings and well-being.

<b>Make friends with your emotions:</b>
All emotions are part of you and there are no good or bad emotions. Our feelings, whether they are comfortable or not, serve a function and can give us important information about our lives and our well-being. So rather than engaging in battle with them, try befriending and taking control of your emotions instead. We must acknowledge our emotions as they happen. They are bursts of energy within us, and ignoring our emotions gives them power.


<b>Name It to Tame It:</b>
Give a name, color and emoji/image to your emotions. Knowing someone‚Äôs name tells them that they are seen, known, and connected. Our emotions deserve the same respect. This way you also have a better connection with your emotions and you are able to control them better.


<b>Track emotion reactions:</b>
Tracking your emotion reactions helps you identify patterns in your moods and triggers that affect your emotions. Emotional awareness will give you insight into how you are experiencing the emotion beforehand.


<b>Track your mood:</b>
A mood calendar is a simple but effective way of keeping track of your moods and mood comments. It can help you identify patterns and establish better understanding of your well-being. Keeping a mood calendar can be done with little effort, but the benefits can be huge for your well-being.


<b>Positive emotions:</b>
Positive emotions don't just feel good ‚Äî they're good for you.

Positive emotions have numerous benefits to health and well-being, and when we feel more positive emotions than negative ones, difficult situations are easier to handle.

Identifying, naming, coloring and tracking your positive emotions is a way to increase positive emotions in everyday life.

By tracking positive emotions, you can be more aware of the positive feelings you already experience and the triggers, situations or activities that bring them, and you can have more of them in your life.

You can also focus on a specific positive emotion and act to increase it. When you know what triggers the positive emotions you want to increase, you can try to increase those situations and activities in your everyday life.


<b>Negative emotions:</b>
Accepting that negative emotions, in ourselves and others, are part of being human allows us to build greater compassion for how others might present themselves and why.

Name It to Tame It: Label your emotions to overcome negative thoughts. Research has shown that mere labeling of negative emotions can help people recover control.

By tracking your emotion reactions, triggers and moods, you can learn how your lifestyle, diet, sleep patterns, and activity affect your negative emotions. You can also begin to predict when certain situations will lead to negative emotions and develop healthy coping mechanisms for handling them.


<b>Emotion triggers:</b>
Emotion triggers are unique to each person. Triggers can be people, places or things, as well as smells, words or colors. Emotion triggers can also be automatic responses to the way others express emotions, like anger or sadness.

Tracking positive emotion triggers helps you be more aware of the positive feelings you already experience, and the situations or activities that bring them, and you can encourage more of them in your life.

Addressing the root cause of your negative emotion triggers can help lessen their impact over time. Becoming more aware of your triggers ‚Äî and what to do when they appear ‚Äî can improve your overall well-being and control of your emotions.


Trust your feelings no matter what they are, and trust yourself. Your emotions are part of you üôÇ","An easy way to track emotions and moods.

Find all the tools you need for better mental health within Moodflow!

<b>Moodflow</b> is a beautiful, modern and FREE app that captures your <u>emotions</u>, <u>moods</u>, <u>thoughts</u>, and <u>general well-being</u>. In addition, Moodflow goes along with you throughout your life, and <i>gives you a deeper understanding of yourself</i>, not previously known to you. Ultimately, this will allow you to improve your mental health and help you become a better you.

ü§ó HOW DOES MOODFLOW WORK? 
<b>You do not even need to write anything down to get a meaningful insight or to keep a diary.</b>

This is how easy Moodflow works:
Fill out a quick survey every day and gain insight into the WHAT and HOW it influences you over time.

‚Ä¢ <b>1.</b> Pick a rating for the day from 1 to 5.
‚Ä¢ <b>2.</b> Pick the emotions you experienced.
‚Ä¢ <b>3.</b> (optional) Write a note about everything important from the day.
‚Ä¢ <b>4.</b> (optional) Pick the activities you did during the day.
‚Ä¢ <b>5.</b> DONE! üòÅ

üëÄWHAT WILL THIS DATA DO FOR ME?
As time goes by, these short entries will gather insightful data about yourself that you will be able to analyze in many ways. On the one hand, a Calendar will be filled with colors that reflect your emotional well-being. This will allow you to get an eagle-eye perspective on your life that you never had before. On the other hand, Moodflow comes with data-analyzing tools, that will help you <b>find relationships between a plethora of different factors and your mood</b>. Moodflow will help you understand yourself better by allowing you to identify the things that <b>bring you up ‚Üë</b> or those that <b>pull you down ‚Üì</b>.

üëèWHAT ELSE CAN MOODFLOW OFFER?
Additionally, Moodflow encourages you to develop better habits by including 28-day challenges. These challenges have different levels of difficulty and will ensure that you create simple but powerful habits. As some have claimed: <b>""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is therefore not an act, but a habit"".</b>

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.

This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Be your own best friend, cheerleader, spiritual guru, etc. with our carefully crafted daily journal prompts. It‚Äôs an easy way to incorporate self reflection into your life, and reflect on all the things that matter. 

Your diary is not just about writing what you ate for lunch. Instead, you can befriend yourself with thought-provoking prompts from day one. Reflect on your hopes and dreams, and really listen to yourself like a compassionate friend. If you‚Äôve ever struggled to keep up with a diary, our daily journal prompts can remove the struggle of thinking of things to say, and make this journaling habit easy to maintain.

Each journal prompt comes with ‚ÄúDive Deeper‚Äù questions to help you get the most out of your self care journal:
E.g. For the writing prompt: ‚ÄúLove is‚Ä¶‚Äù, reflect on Dive Deeper questions like ‚ÄúHow do you show love towards others? How do others show love towards you? What was your first memory of feeling loved? Does love have a spiritual dimension for you? If so, how?‚Äù 
The Dive Deeper questions help prevent writer‚Äôs block, making journaling a powerful wellness tool from day one.

A daily diary can seem daunting, even tedious ‚Äî when in fact, journaling can be a powerful self care habit. Read through our reviews: you‚Äôll find users who have used this app as a therapy journal, a self help aid, and a thought diary of everything important to them. Your daily journal can be a deeply rewarding wellness ritual that helps you write thoughts you might have otherwise ignored. We hope Prompted Journal helps you uncover more of what you‚Äôre meant be. 

This writing app can feel like traveling through time. On day one, you‚Äôll write a letter to your future self (1st prompt: Dear Future Me). About 3-4 months later, when the prompt recycles, you‚Äôll be able to read your letter. While we love the physical diary, writing apps make it possible to instantly find the last time you answered the same journal prompt, or view ALL the times you answered the prompt at once. Watch your self esteem improve with each new cycle: your answers to journal prompts like ‚ÄúMy biggest fear‚Ä¶‚Äù might show how you have overcome anxiety. This writing app becomes a conversation between you, your past self, and your future self. Your diary becomes a memento of how much you‚Äôve grown. Just by incorporating a simple 5 minute journal habit into your life, you can get to know yourself again.

WHAT YOU GET:
* Self care journaling for busy lives: 190+ journal prompts ready to go, recurring every 3-4 months.
* Daily reminders help you write and reflect every day.
* Create a PDF of your diary to print, email, or save.
* Daily journaling made easy.

Life is a journey, and our prompts are designed to help you reflect daily on where you‚Äôre heading. Write your thoughts on everything from mental health to love to self esteem. Make the five minute journal session you can squeeze into your mornings equate to five hours of talking with your best friend. Also, customize your guided journal by making journal prompts that only you can: e.g. ‚ÄúMy dog Lucy and I‚Ä¶‚Äù With a wide range of topics you can reflect on, you can see yourself in from various angles. 

OUR MISSION:
Self help and self therapy are difficult because all the incredible books and spot-on teachings don‚Äôt force you to put them into practice. ‚ÄúLove yourself,‚Äù ‚ÄúBe grateful,‚Äù etc. sound simple, but can be surprisingly hard to do. We hope our writing apps turn apparently ‚Äúsimple‚Äù self help mantras like ‚ÄúLove yourself‚Äù into wellness habits you can practice daily.

Terms of Service: https://darlingapps.com/terms-of-service","A daily journal for self-compassion.<br><br>Be your own best friend, cheerleader, spiritual guru, etc. with our carefully crafted daily journal prompts. It‚Äôs an easy way to incorporate self reflection into your life, and reflect on all the things that matter. <br><br>Your diary is not just about writing what you ate for lunch. Instead, you can befriend yourself with thought-provoking prompts from day one. Reflect on your hopes and dreams, and really listen to yourself like a compassionate friend. If you‚Äôve ever struggled to keep up with a diary, our daily journal prompts can remove the struggle of thinking of things to say, and make this journaling habit easy to maintain.<br><br>Each journal prompt comes with ‚ÄúDive Deeper‚Äù questions to help you get the most out of your self care journal:<br>E.g. For the writing prompt: ‚ÄúLove is‚Ä¶‚Äù, reflect on Dive Deeper questions like ‚ÄúHow do you show love towards others? How do others show love towards you? What was your first memory of feeling loved? Does love have a spiritual dimension for you? If so, how?‚Äù <br>The Dive Deeper questions help prevent writer‚Äôs block, making journaling a powerful wellness tool from day one.<br><br>A daily diary can seem daunting, even tedious ‚Äî when in fact, journaling can be a powerful self care habit. Read through our reviews: you‚Äôll find users who have used this app as a therapy journal, a self help aid, and a thought diary of everything important to them. Your daily journal can be a deeply rewarding wellness ritual that helps you write thoughts you might have otherwise ignored. We hope Prompted Journal helps you uncover more of what you‚Äôre meant be. <br><br>This writing app can feel like traveling through time. On day one, you‚Äôll write a letter to your future self (1st prompt: Dear Future Me). About 3-4 months later, when the prompt recycles, you‚Äôll be able to read your letter. While we love the physical diary, writing apps make it possible to instantly find the last time you answered the same journal prompt, or view ALL the times you answered the prompt at once. Watch your self esteem improve with each new cycle: your answers to journal prompts like ‚ÄúMy biggest fear‚Ä¶‚Äù might show how you have overcome anxiety. This writing app becomes a conversation between you, your past self, and your future self. Your diary becomes a memento of how much you‚Äôve grown. Just by incorporating a simple 5 minute journal habit into your life, you can get to know yourself again.<br><br>WHAT YOU GET:<br>* Self care journaling for busy lives: 190+ journal prompts ready to go, recurring every 3-4 months.<br>* Daily reminders help you write and reflect every day.<br>* Create a PDF of your diary to print, email, or save.<br>* Daily journaling made easy.<br><br>Life is a journey, and our prompts are designed to help you reflect daily on where you‚Äôre heading. Write your thoughts on everything from mental health to love to self esteem. Make the five minute journal session you can squeeze into your mornings equate to five hours of talking with your best friend. Also, customize your guided journal by making journal prompts that only you can: e.g. ‚ÄúMy dog Lucy and I‚Ä¶‚Äù With a wide range of topics you can reflect on, you can see yourself in from various angles. <br><br>OUR MISSION:<br>Self help and self therapy are difficult because all the incredible books and spot-on teachings don‚Äôt force you to put them into practice. ‚ÄúLove yourself,‚Äù ‚ÄúBe grateful,‚Äù etc. sound simple, but can be surprisingly hard to do. We hope our writing apps turn apparently ‚Äúsimple‚Äù self help mantras like ‚ÄúLove yourself‚Äù into wellness habits you can practice daily.<br><br>* We specialize in writing apps that foster self care and wellness.

With gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.

To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.

And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.

Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:

1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL

A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life. 

In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. 

The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. 

You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.

2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS

If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations. 

Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. 

They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.

The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. 

You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.

Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.

3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS

Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.

In the Gratitude app, we‚Äôll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!

4. üåàDAILY ZEN

We understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app. 

Here, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.

One simple switch can begin a massive change in your life. A self-care tool like Gratitude will help you build a healthy routine to take care of your mental health, achieve your goals, and live a beautiful life.","The Gratitude app is a carefully-designed self-care tool to help you focus on your mental health.<br><br>With gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.<br><br>To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.<br><br>And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.<br><br>Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:<br><br>1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL<br><br>A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life. <br><br>In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. <br><br>The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. <br><br>You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.<br><br>2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS<br><br>If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations. <br><br>Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. <br><br>They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.<br><br>The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. <br><br>You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.<br><br>Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.<br><br>3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS<br><br>Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board.

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

Name it to tame it, track emotion reactions, triggers, secondary emotions, and your emotion reaction and mood comments. Find patterns in your moods and triggers that affect your emotions to improve your overall good feelings and well-being.

<b>Make friends with your emotions:</b>
All emotions are part of you and there are no good or bad emotions. Our feelings, whether they are comfortable or not, serve a function and can give us important information about our lives and our well-being. So rather than engaging in battle with them, try befriending and taking control of your emotions instead. We must acknowledge our emotions as they happen. They are bursts of energy within us, and ignoring our emotions gives them power.


<b>Name It to Tame It:</b>
Give a name, color and emoji/image to your emotions. Knowing someone‚Äôs name tells them that they are seen, known, and connected. Our emotions deserve the same respect. This way you also have a better connection with your emotions and you are able to control them better.


<b>Track emotion reactions:</b>
Tracking your emotion reactions helps you identify patterns in your moods and triggers that affect your emotions. Emotional awareness will give you insight into how you are experiencing the emotion beforehand.


<b>Track your mood:</b>
A mood calendar is a simple but effective way of keeping track of your moods and mood comments. It can help you identify patterns and establish better understanding of your well-being. Keeping a mood calendar can be done with little effort, but the benefits can be huge for your well-being.


<b>Positive emotions:</b>
Positive emotions don't just feel good ‚Äî they're good for you.

Positive emotions have numerous benefits to health and well-being, and when we feel more positive emotions than negative ones, difficult situations are easier to handle.

Identifying, naming, coloring and tracking your positive emotions is a way to increase positive emotions in everyday life.

By tracking positive emotions, you can be more aware of the positive feelings you already experience and the triggers, situations or activities that bring them, and you can have more of them in your life.

You can also focus on a specific positive emotion and act to increase it. When you know what triggers the positive emotions you want to increase, you can try to increase those situations and activities in your everyday life.


<b>Negative emotions:</b>
Accepting that negative emotions, in ourselves and others, are part of being human allows us to build greater compassion for how others might present themselves and why.

Name It to Tame It: Label your emotions to overcome negative thoughts. Research has shown that mere labeling of negative emotions can help people recover control.

By tracking your emotion reactions, triggers and moods, you can learn how your lifestyle, diet, sleep patterns, and activity affect your negative emotions. You can also begin to predict when certain situations will lead to negative emotions and develop healthy coping mechanisms for handling them.


<b>Emotion triggers:</b>
Emotion triggers are unique to each person. Triggers can be people, places or things, as well as smells, words or colors. Emotion triggers can also be automatic responses to the way others express emotions, like anger or sadness.

Tracking positive emotion triggers helps you be more aware of the positive feelings you already experience, and the situations or activities that bring them, and you can encourage more of them in your life.

Addressing the root cause of your negative emotion triggers can help lessen their impact over time. Becoming more aware of your triggers ‚Äî and what to do when they appear ‚Äî can improve your overall well-being and control of your emotions.


Trust your feelings no matter what they are, and trust yourself. Your emotions are part of you üôÇ","An easy way to track emotions and moods.

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

<b>Moodflow</b> is a beautiful, modern and FREE app that captures your <u>emotions</u>, <u>moods</u>, <u>thoughts</u>, and <u>general well-being</u>.

ü§ó HOW DOES MOODFLOW WORK? 
<b>You do not even need to write anything down to get a meaningful insight or to keep a diary.</b>

This is how easy Moodflow works:
Fill out a quick survey every day and gain insight into the WHAT and HOW it influences you over time.

‚Ä¢ <b>1.</b> Pick a rating for the day from 1 to 5.
‚Ä¢ <b>2.</b> Pick the emotions you experienced.
‚Ä¢ <b>3.</b> (optional) Write a note about everything important from the day.
‚Ä¢ <b>4.</b> (optional) Pick the activities you did during the day.
‚Ä¢ <b>5.</b> DONE! üòÅ

üëÄWHAT WILL THIS DATA DO FOR ME?

<h2><b>Note</b></h2>
Due to its many features <i>Mood Patterns</i> is NOT the simplest mood tracker. It probably will take you a few minutes until you know your way around the app. But we try our hardest to make it worth your while with helpful, detailed, and multifaceted insights. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask them at contact@moodpatterns.info or our FB page (link in the app).

 <h1><b>Details</b></h1>
<h2><b>Gain insights into your feelings</b></h2>
A mood journal or mood diary is a great way to keep a record of your feelings, but <i>Mood Patterns</i> can do much more for you. It is not just a mood tracker but links how you feel, to your location, company, and activity as well as to how you slept and to recent events in your life. Use it to explore the patterns in your mood.

<h2><b>Capture how you feel in your daily life</b></h2>
Classical diaries have one major flaw - they are subject to recall bias. Some activities in our lives are more salient than others. We remember them better and more vividly and therefore often believe they take a larger part of each day than they do. However, for most of us, routines fill the largest part of our daily life, and those are often overlooked in diaries. 

To capture all parts of your life that matter <i>Mood Patterns</i> uses a technique of the social sciences: <b>ecological momentary assessment</b> also known as <b>experience sampling</b>.

<h2><b>You are unique</b></h2>
Where we go, who we meet, and what we do is individual. With <i>Mood Patterns</i>, you do not have to choose from a fixed set of categories but can tailor your options to your personal needs. Be as nuanced as you like in configuring places, people, and activities.

<h2><b>Your data is yours</b></h2>
How you feel is sensitive private data. We believe it should not be carelessly entrusted to anybody. <i>Mood Patterns</i>  <b>does not request Internet permission</b>, therefore no data transfer in the background without your knowledge is possible. <i>Mood Patterns</i> will not send us or anybody else your data.

<h2><b>Your data is safe</b></h2>
Denying <i>Mood Patterns</i> Internet access frees you from the need to trust us, but what about others? An <b>app lock</b> assures that only you can use your <i>Mood Patterns</i> app. To prevent that the app lock is bypassed by connecting your mobile phone to a PC, all data is <b>256-bit AES encrypted</b>. Unfortunately, there is no 100% safety, but Mood Patterns makes it hard to get your data without your consent.","<h1><b>Overview</b></h1><br><h2><b>General Features</b></h2><br>* usable as a mood tracker, mood diary, and mood journal<br>* further application fields: symptom tracker and sleep journal<br>* avoid recall bias with experience sampling<br>* as many surveys per day as you like<br>* 30 predefined mood scales<br>* 30 fully customizable scales<br>* customizable additionally data:<br> - places<br> - people<br> - activities<br> - factors<br> - sleep<br> - events<br> - phone usage<br>* set alerts to be notified if your mood level or variation changes<br>* get associations between mood and additional data<br>* explore mood before and after an event<br>* surveys can include notes<br>* markdown formatting of notes<br>* see data in beautiful, zoomable graphs<br>* export graphs<br>* export data <br>* light and dark theme<br><br><h2><b>Security Features</b></h2><br>* NO internet connection<br>* App lock (with fingerprint)<br>* encryption of stored data<br><br><h2><b>Note</b></h2><br>Due to its many features <i>Mood Patterns</i> is NOT the simplest mood tracker.

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

Be your own best friend, cheerleader, spiritual guru, etc. with our carefully crafted daily journal prompts. It‚Äôs an easy way to incorporate self reflection into your life, and reflect on all the things that matter. 

Your diary is not just about writing what you ate for lunch. Instead, you can befriend yourself with thought-provoking prompts from day one. Reflect on your hopes and dreams, and really listen to yourself like a compassionate friend. If you‚Äôve ever struggled to keep up with a diary, our daily journal prompts can remove the struggle of thinking of things to say, and make this journaling habit easy to maintain.

Each journal prompt comes with ‚ÄúDive Deeper‚Äù questions to help you get the most out of your self care journal:
E.g. For the writing prompt: ‚ÄúLove is‚Ä¶‚Äù, reflect on Dive Deeper questions like ‚ÄúHow do you show love towards others? How do others show love towards you? What was your first memory of feeling loved? Does love have a spiritual dimension for you? If so, how?‚Äù 
The Dive Deeper questions help prevent writer‚Äôs block, making journaling a powerful wellness tool from day one.

A daily diary can seem daunting, even tedious ‚Äî when in fact, journaling can be a powerful self care habit. Read through our reviews: you‚Äôll find users who have used this app as a therapy journal, a self help aid, and a thought diary of everything important to them. Your daily journal can be a deeply rewarding wellness ritual that helps you write thoughts you might have otherwise ignored. We hope Prompted Journal helps you uncover more of what you‚Äôre meant be. 

This writing app can feel like traveling through time. On day one, you‚Äôll write a letter to your future self (1st prompt: Dear Future Me). About 3-4 months later, when the prompt recycles, you‚Äôll be able to read your letter. While we love the physical diary, writing apps make it possible to instantly find the last time you answered the same journal prompt, or view ALL the times you answered the prompt at once. Watch your self esteem improve with each new cycle: your answers to journal prompts like ‚ÄúMy biggest fear‚Ä¶‚Äù might show how you have overcome anxiety. This writing app becomes a conversation between you, your past self, and your future self. Your diary becomes a memento of how much you‚Äôve grown. Just by incorporating a simple 5 minute journal habit into your life, you can get to know yourself again.

WHAT YOU GET:
* Self care journaling for busy lives: 190+ journal prompts ready to go, recurring every 3-4 months.
* Daily reminders help you write and reflect every day.
* Create a PDF of your diary to print, email, or save.
* Daily journaling made easy.

Life is a journey, and our prompts are designed to help you reflect daily on where you‚Äôre heading. Write your thoughts on everything from mental health to love to self esteem. Make the five minute journal session you can squeeze into your mornings equate to five hours of talking with your best friend. Also, customize your guided journal by making journal prompts that only you can: e.g. ‚ÄúMy dog Lucy and I‚Ä¶‚Äù With a wide range of topics you can reflect on, you can see yourself in from various angles. 

OUR MISSION:
Self help and self therapy are difficult because all the incredible books and spot-on teachings don‚Äôt force you to put them into practice. ‚ÄúLove yourself,‚Äù ‚ÄúBe grateful,‚Äù etc. sound simple, but can be surprisingly hard to do. We hope our writing apps turn apparently ‚Äúsimple‚Äù self help mantras like ‚ÄúLove yourself‚Äù into wellness habits you can practice daily.

* We specialize in writing apps that foster self care and wellness. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us.

WE RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY:
Your daily journal is yours and yours alone. We don‚Äôt store any of your data or ask you to create an account. We built this diary journal with your privacy in mind.

With gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.

To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.

And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.

Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:

1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL

A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life. 

In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. 

The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. 

You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.

2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS

If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations. 

Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. 

They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.

The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. 

You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.

Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.

3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS

Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.

In the Gratitude app, we‚Äôll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!

4. üåàDAILY ZEN

We understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app. 

Here, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.

One simple switch can begin a massive change in your life. A self-care tool like Gratitude will help you build a healthy routine to take care of your mental health, achieve your goals, and live a beautiful life.","The Gratitude app is a carefully-designed self-care tool to help you focus on your mental health.<br><br>With gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.<br><br>To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.<br><br>And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.<br><br>Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:<br><br>1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL<br><br>A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life. <br><br>In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. <br><br>The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. <br><br>You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.<br><br>2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS<br><br>If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations. <br><br>Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. <br><br>They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.<br><br>The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. <br><br>You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.<br><br>Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.<br><br>3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS<br><br>Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board.

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

<b>Moodflow</b> is a beautiful, modern and FREE app that captures your <u>emotions</u>, <u>moods</u>, <u>thoughts</u>, and <u>general well-being</u>. In addition, Moodflow goes along with you throughout your life, and <i>gives you a deeper understanding of yourself</i>, not previously known to you.

ü§ó HOW DOES MOODFLOW WORK? 
<b>You do not even need to write anything down to get a meaningful insight or to keep a diary.</b>

This is how easy Moodflow works:
Fill out a quick survey every day and gain insight into the WHAT and HOW it influences you over time.

‚Ä¢ <b>1.</b> Pick a rating for the day from 1 to 5.
‚Ä¢ <b>2.</b> Pick the emotions you experienced.
‚Ä¢ <b>3.</b> (optional) Write a note about everything important from the day.
‚Ä¢ <b>4.</b> (optional) Pick the activities you did during the day.
‚Ä¢ <b>5.</b> DONE! üòÅ

üëÄWHAT WILL THIS DATA DO FOR ME?
As time goes by, these short entries will gather insightful data about yourself that you will be able to analyze in many ways. On the one hand, a Calendar will be filled with colors that reflect your emotional well-being. This will allow you to get an eagle-eye perspective on your life that you never had before. On the other hand, Moodflow comes with data-analyzing tools, that will help you <b>find relationships between a plethora of different factors and your mood</b>. Moodflow will help you understand yourself better by allowing you to identify the things that <b>bring you up ‚Üë</b> or those that <b>pull you down ‚Üì</b>.

üëèWHAT ELSE CAN MOODFLOW OFFER?
Additionally, Moodflow encourages you to develop better habits by including 28-day challenges. These challenges have different levels of difficulty and will ensure that you create simple but powerful habits. As some have claimed: <b>""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is therefore not an act, but a habit"".</b>

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

<b>Get to know yourself by diving deeply into your passions, feelings, and life goals.</b>

<b>Mental health</b> is a highly complex machine and sometimes it falls into depression. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) journal comes to help through dozens of effective techniques:

Destructive factors affect our mind permanently causing bipolar depression or anxiety. An excessive amount of information, lack of self-care culture - all these things influence negatively mental health.

Be your own best friend, cheerleader, spiritual guru, etc. with our carefully crafted daily journal prompts. It‚Äôs an easy way to incorporate self reflection into your life, and reflect on all the things that matter. 

Your diary is not just about writing what you ate for lunch. Instead, you can befriend yourself with thought-provoking prompts from day one. Reflect on your hopes and dreams, and really listen to yourself like a compassionate friend. If you‚Äôve ever struggled to keep up with a diary, our daily journal prompts can remove the struggle of thinking of things to say, and make this journaling habit easy to maintain.

Each journal prompt comes with ‚ÄúDive Deeper‚Äù questions to help you get the most out of your self care journal:
E.g. For the writing prompt: ‚ÄúLove is‚Ä¶‚Äù, reflect on Dive Deeper questions like ‚ÄúHow do you show love towards others? How do others show love towards you? What was your first memory of feeling loved? Does love have a spiritual dimension for you? If so, how?‚Äù 
The Dive Deeper questions help prevent writer‚Äôs block, making journaling a powerful wellness tool from day one.

A daily diary can seem daunting, even tedious ‚Äî when in fact, journaling can be a powerful self care habit. Read through our reviews: you‚Äôll find users who have used this app as a therapy journal, a self help aid, and a thought diary of everything important to them. Your daily journal can be a deeply rewarding wellness ritual that helps you write thoughts you might have otherwise ignored. We hope Prompted Journal helps you uncover more of what you‚Äôre meant be. 

This writing app can feel like traveling through time. On day one, you‚Äôll write a letter to your future self (1st prompt: Dear Future Me). About 3-4 months later, when the prompt recycles, you‚Äôll be able to read your letter. While we love the physical diary, writing apps make it possible to instantly find the last time you answered the same journal prompt, or view ALL the times you answered the prompt at once. Watch your self esteem improve with each new cycle: your answers to journal prompts like ‚ÄúMy biggest fear‚Ä¶‚Äù might show how you have overcome anxiety. This writing app becomes a conversation between you, your past self, and your future self. Your diary becomes a memento of how much you‚Äôve grown. Just by incorporating a simple 5 minute journal habit into your life, you can get to know yourself again.

WHAT YOU GET:
* Self care journaling for busy lives: 190+ journal prompts ready to go, recurring every 3-4 months.
* Daily reminders help you write and reflect every day.
* Create a PDF of your diary to print, email, or save.
* Daily journaling made easy.

Life is a journey, and our prompts are designed to help you reflect daily on where you‚Äôre heading. Write your thoughts on everything from mental health to love to self esteem. Make the five minute journal session you can squeeze into your mornings equate to five hours of talking with your best friend. Also, customize your guided journal by making journal prompts that only you can: e.g. ‚ÄúMy dog Lucy and I‚Ä¶‚Äù With a wide range of topics you can reflect on, you can see yourself in from various angles. 

OUR MISSION:
Self help and self therapy are difficult because all the incredible books and spot-on teachings don‚Äôt force you to put them into practice. ‚ÄúLove yourself,‚Äù ‚ÄúBe grateful,‚Äù etc. sound simple, but can be surprisingly hard to do. We hope our writing apps turn apparently ‚Äúsimple‚Äù self help mantras like ‚ÄúLove yourself‚Äù into wellness habits you can practice daily.

* We specialize in writing apps that foster self care and wellness. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us.

WE RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY:
Your daily journal is yours and yours alone. We don‚Äôt store any of your data or ask you to create an account. We built this diary journal with your privacy in mind.

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

HabitBull is the most powerful multi-platform companion to keep track of your day to day habits and routines

¬ª Fully Customisable
Measure and track anything and everything. Follow your own schedule and track your own goals. Get notified whenever you need to do something important.

¬ª Cut Bad Habits From Your Life
Simply start tracking bad habits like nail biting, smoking or drinking too much. Once you see the patterns, it's easier to break them. HabitBull keeps you accountable. Also great for users of NoFap!

¬ª Add Some Positive Habits
Want to go for a nice walk every day? Or maybe give 3 hugs every Saturday and Sunday? Join us on this journey!

¬ª Who is it for?
Whether you want to read some more, stop smoking, start working out or even just track how many hours you wasted on Facebook, this app lets you do it!

¬ª Features
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Track multiple habits, repeated to do's or goals, each in its own calendar
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Streak counter and percentage successful for each habit
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Yes/No or Number goals
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Very flexible goals like: number of times per day/week/month, only on certain days of the week etc. For example: 30 push ups every Mon-Fri, go to the gym 2 times per week, or even every 2 days
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Inspiring quotes per category - including actual quotes from people doing it (meditation, reading, stop drinking alcohol, stop smoking cigarettes, stop procrastination etc)
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Graphs with success percentage / streak, entered values etc
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Powerful reminders - multiple times per day, repeating within a time period, sound and vibrate optional
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Home screen / lock screen widget
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Multi-device syncing
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Cloud backup
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Motivational images
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Export to CSV
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Dark theme
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Google Fit integration

¬ª How it works:
1. Set up a habit
2. Tell HabitBull how you went for a day
3. Watch your daily streak increase

Habits are no more than routines which you perform subconsciously. To build one - train yourself. To break one, find another one which is similar, yet different and nicer, and repeat it until it sticks.

To assist you with this HabitBull lets you set reminders for each habit and displays them on days when you need to be successful. This is especially useful if you have a to do list with repeating tasks or if you want to be reminded to do the same thing every day. It can also be used as a calendar planning tool or checklist, but also as a very effective repeating reminder (e.g. to drink water every 2 hours).

HabitBull does feel a little like a game in which you compete with yourself. The task is to get a long streak for the habit you are working on by covering your goals. The longer the better. It takes a couple of months to fully build a new routine, so don't give up - it takes time and if you are consistent it will work; even if it takes a few attempts.

There are many things which you may want to improve. HabitBull can be used as a planner in building habits like taking your pills regularly, exercise, or keep to a diet. It can also be used as a helper for people suffering from memory problems. As for your vices, HabitBull can be a useful goal tracking tool, or a smart notebook, to assist you while breaking bad habits like nail-biting, drinking alcohol and even improving your dating skills.
It is entirely up to you, really.

BASED ON SCIENCE AND PROVEN TO WORK

Youper uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques, the scientifically proven way to improve your mood.

They are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D./PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional therapists (LPC), or similar credentials.
 
All of our therapists have a Master‚Äôs Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice.
 
<b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b>
After filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs and preferences. You and your therapist will get your own secure and private ‚Äútherapy room‚Äù where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. You can also schedule a weekly session to speak live with your therapist over video or phone.
 
You can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions, and discuss the challenges you‚Äôre facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights, and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.
 
Together you‚Äôll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals, and overcoming your problems.
 
<b>HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?</b>
The cost of therapy through BetterHelp ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your BetterHelp membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the therapy service itself.

‚Ä¢ Using someone else's route from GPX, KML or KMZ file;
‚Ä¢ Marking important or interesting points on your way;
‚Ä¢ Locating a point on the map, if you know its coordinates;
‚Ä¢ Showing off colorful screenshots of your accomplishments in social networks.


You can view the tracks and the surrounding area in the application using scheme from OSM, Google or Yandex, as well as satellite images from Google or Mapbox - this way you will always have the most detailed map of the area anywhere worldwide. The map areas you view are saved to your phone and remain available offline for a while (this works best for OSM maps and Mapbox's satellite images). To record and calculate track's statistics only a gps signal is needed - Internet is only required to download map images.


While driving, you can turn on the navigation mode, in which the map automatically rotates in the direction of travel, which greatly simplifies navigation.


The application can record tracks while being in background (on many devices, this requires additional configuration in the system - be careful! The instructions for these settings are available in the application). Power consumption in background mode is greatly optimized - on average, the phone's charge is enough for a whole day of recording. There's also an economy mode - you can turn it on in the app settings.


Geo Tracker calculates the following statistics:
‚Ä¢ Distance traveled and recording time;
‚Ä¢ Max and average speed on the track;
‚Ä¢ Time and average speed in motion;
‚Ä¢ Min and max altitude on the track, altitude difference;
‚Ä¢ Vertical distance, ascent and speed;
‚Ä¢ Min, max and average slope.


Also there are detailed charts of speed and elevation data available.


Recorded tracks can be stored as GPX, KML and KMZ files, so they can be used in other well-known applications like Google Earth or Ozi Explorer. Tracks are stored locally on your device and are not transferred to any servers.


The app does not make money from ads or your personal data. To support the development of the project, a voluntary donation can be made in the application.


Useful tips & tricks to solve common GPS issues with your smartphone:
‚Ä¢ If you start the tracking please wait with recording your activity until the GPS signal is found.
‚Ä¢ Restart your smartphone and make sure that you have ""clear view"" of the sky before you start (no disturbing objects like high buildings, forest, etc.).
‚Ä¢ The reception conditions are permanently changing because they got influenced by the following factors: weather, season, positioning of satellites, areas with bad GPS coverage, high buildings, forest, etc.).
‚Ä¢ Go to phone settings, choose ""Location"" and activate it.
‚Ä¢ Go to phone settings, choose ""Date & time"" and activate the following options: ""Automatic date & time"" and ""Automatic time zone"". It may occur that it takes longer until the GPS signal is found if your smartphone is set to the wrong time zone.
‚Ä¢ Deactivate the airplane mode in your phone settings.


If none of these tips & tricks helped to solve your issues, deinstall the app and reinstall it again.
Be aware that Google uses in their Google Maps app not only the GPS data but also additional data of the current location from surrounding WLAN networks and/or mobile networks.

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

Be your own best friend, cheerleader, spiritual guru, etc. with our carefully crafted daily journal prompts. It‚Äôs an easy way to incorporate self reflection into your life, and reflect on all the things that matter. 

Your diary is not just about writing what you ate for lunch. Instead, you can befriend yourself with thought-provoking prompts from day one. Reflect on your hopes and dreams, and really listen to yourself like a compassionate friend. If you‚Äôve ever struggled to keep up with a diary, our daily journal prompts can remove the struggle of thinking of things to say, and make this journaling habit easy to maintain.

Each journal prompt comes with ‚ÄúDive Deeper‚Äù questions to help you get the most out of your self care journal:
E.g. For the writing prompt: ‚ÄúLove is‚Ä¶‚Äù, reflect on Dive Deeper questions like ‚ÄúHow do you show love towards others? How do others show love towards you? What was your first memory of feeling loved? Does love have a spiritual dimension for you? If so, how?‚Äù 
The Dive Deeper questions help prevent writer‚Äôs block, making journaling a powerful wellness tool from day one.

A daily diary can seem daunting, even tedious ‚Äî when in fact, journaling can be a powerful self care habit. Read through our reviews: you‚Äôll find users who have used this app as a therapy journal, a self help aid, and a thought diary of everything important to them. Your daily journal can be a deeply rewarding wellness ritual that helps you write thoughts you might have otherwise ignored. We hope Prompted Journal helps you uncover more of what you‚Äôre meant be. 

This writing app can feel like traveling through time. On day one, you‚Äôll write a letter to your future self (1st prompt: Dear Future Me). About 3-4 months later, when the prompt recycles, you‚Äôll be able to read your letter. While we love the physical diary, writing apps make it possible to instantly find the last time you answered the same journal prompt, or view ALL the times you answered the prompt at once. Watch your self esteem improve with each new cycle: your answers to journal prompts like ‚ÄúMy biggest fear‚Ä¶‚Äù might show how you have overcome anxiety. This writing app becomes a conversation between you, your past self, and your future self. Your diary becomes a memento of how much you‚Äôve grown. Just by incorporating a simple 5 minute journal habit into your life, you can get to know yourself again.

WHAT YOU GET:
* Self care journaling for busy lives: 190+ journal prompts ready to go, recurring every 3-4 months.
* Daily reminders help you write and reflect every day.
* Create a PDF of your diary to print, email, or save.
* Daily journaling made easy.

Life is a journey, and our prompts are designed to help you reflect daily on where you‚Äôre heading. Write your thoughts on everything from mental health to love to self esteem. Make the five minute journal session you can squeeze into your mornings equate to five hours of talking with your best friend. Also, customize your guided journal by making journal prompts that only you can: e.g. ‚ÄúMy dog Lucy and I‚Ä¶‚Äù With a wide range of topics you can reflect on, you can see yourself in from various angles. 

OUR MISSION:
Self help and self therapy are difficult because all the incredible books and spot-on teachings don‚Äôt force you to put them into practice. ‚ÄúLove yourself,‚Äù ‚ÄúBe grateful,‚Äù etc. sound simple, but can be surprisingly hard to do. We hope our writing apps turn apparently ‚Äúsimple‚Äù self help mantras like ‚ÄúLove yourself‚Äù into wellness habits you can practice daily.

* We specialize in writing apps that foster self care and wellness. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us.

WE RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY:

1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL

A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life. 

In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. 

The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. 

You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.

2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS

If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations. 

Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. 

They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.

The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. 

You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.

Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.

3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS

Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.

In the Gratitude app, we‚Äôll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!

BASED ON SCIENCE AND PROVEN TO WORK

Youper uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques, the scientifically proven way to improve your mood.

A study from Stanford University showed significant improvement in symptoms of depression and anxiety after using the Youper app.

CREATED TO FIT YOUR BUSY ROUTINE

Traditionally, CBT has been carried out with a therapist in sessions lasting 30 to 60 minutes once or twice a week, creating a barrier for busy people or those who don't like talking to a therapist about their private feelings.

Youper was created by therapists to make CBT accessible for everyone. Youper allows you to benefit from CBT without the hassle of traditional therapy sessions. Youper is available wherever and whenever you need it, on your own time and schedule.

2. Want to stop negative thinking, rumination, and toxic self-talk?
3. Want help in understanding how to deal with a stressful situation?
4. Want to find the motivation to achieve your goals?

Your journey to better mental health starts today!

Records Management Mobile Application

The Department of Navy (DON) Records Management application is the mobile version of the DON Records Management training course available via NKO.  This mandatory annual training provides personnel with Records Management guidelines and best practices in accordance with Federal regulations. The training helps users understand general recordkeeping methods and their own duties regarding the records they are responsible for maintaining.  It also educates the user on eliminating hardcopy records in favor of electronic records.  .

All DON personnel are responsible for maintaining records that they have created. Legally, a record is defined as all recorded information, regardless of form or characteristics, made or received by a Federal agency in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved (or appropriate for preservation) by that agency as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the U.S. Government.  Examples of records include final original documents, official correspondence and memoranda, senior official emails, signed policy records, personnel case files, legal records, and financial records, among other items. 

Records Management involves all planning, controlling, directing, organizing, training, promoting, and other managerial activities associated with records creation, maintenance, use, and disposition. Successful Records Management achieves adequate and proper documentation of the policies and transactions of the Federal Government and effective, economical management of agency operations. 

This app will help you understand the records lifecycle, dispositions, vital records, electronic records, senior records and related information.  In particular, the app will help you understand your own responsibilities regarding Records Management.  Some of those responsibilities include: 
     - Ensuring you know your agency‚Äôs policies and procedures regarding Records Management,
     - Reviewing your office‚Äôs file plan and determining materials you are responsible for maintaining,
     - Following the retention and disposition guidance specified in the records schedule,
     - Informing your Records Manager of any discrepancies or needed updates to the file plan, and 
     - Understanding that you can be held liable if a record is not properly managed.

Course Completion Verification
‚Ä¢ Military personnel may use the app to complete their annual mandatory training. End-of-course completions can be emailed to Navy Training Management and Planning System (NTMPS) for display in the Electronic Training Jacket (ETJ).  
‚Ä¢ Users should retain course Completion Certificate emails in their mobile phone Sent Items folder until successful posting in their ETJ or Fleet Training Management Planning System (FLTMPS) can be verified.
‚Ä¢ If completion does not appear in ETJ or FLTMPS after 72 hours, users may wish to forward a copy of the email to their supervisor or FLTMPS Coordinator/Training POC as verification of completion. If needed, the FLTMPS Coordinator can record course completion manually using the FLTMPS Learning Event Completion Form.

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

Off the Record lets you fight it in under a minute. Top lawyers. Flat fee. Super easy. We have a 97% success rate, and a full money back guarantee. If we don't win your case, you get a full refund in most areas.

With Off the Record (OTR) there's no need to mail in your ticket, no need to show up in court, and no need to meet in person with your lawyer. Your lawyer takes care of all the paper work and all the details.

<b>How it works</b>

1) Snap a photo of your ticket
2) Answer a few simple questions
3) Off the Record matches you with the traffic attorney most likely to win your case

Once that's done, you'll be able to message your lawyer right from the app. And your lawyer will send you real time updates to keep you informed every step of the way.

<b>Why choose Off the Record</b>

‚Äî Best value ‚Äî

Legal fees to fight a traffic ticket vary greatly. At OTR, our lawyers charge a low flat fee with no hidden costs.

‚Äî Smart Match ‚Äî

This is our magic ingredient. We don‚Äôt just match you with any random attorney. Our proprietary Smart Match approach analyzes past data and trends to match you with the traffic attorney most likely to win your case.

‚Äî Experienced ‚Äî

We work only with the most successful, highly rated traffic attorneys in each city.

<b>Thinking of not fighting that ticket? </b>

On average, after your first speeding ticket, insurance premiums increase by $300 per year, for the next three years. That's $900 over the next three years. Contesting your ticket is the financially responsible thing to do! And since OTR gives you a full refund if your case is lost, you have nothing to lose.

Don't let a simple mistake tarnish your driving record and cost you hundreds in increased insurance premiums. Always fight your ticket!","Got a speeding or traffic ticket?

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

This is how a CBT-guided diary works. 

<b>Get to know yourself by diving deeply into your passions, feelings, and life goals.</b>

<b>Mental health</b> is a highly complex machine and sometimes it falls into depression. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) journal comes to help through dozens of effective techniques:
- Mindfulness journaling lets you unwind at the end of the day
- Guided reflection improves mindfulness and teach gratitude
- Mood tracker diary allows keeping track of mood dynamics
- Self-care diary serves for learning new ways of thinking and overcoming depression
- Journal itself makes bipolar smoother

<b>Mood tracker diary is here to find out the prerequisites for depression:</b>
- what time of the day causes a bad mood
- particular activities responsible for negative thoughts
- ineffective behavior

Mental health apps are often hired for fast check-in as if it had been any helpful in the therapy. Mind journal app, on the other hand, provides instruments for deep personal transformations as well as anxiety relief.

Guided journal notebook releases a huge amount of positive energy which is hidden by mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. 

<b> Self-care journaling with Mind Journal consists of these components:</b>
- Relax and reflect in the diary
- 3 to 10 logs with the mood tracker to obtain the whole mental health picture and identify bipolar
- Development of happiness by following anxiety relief journal prompts
- Listening of meditation and affirmation for good sleep

Mental health wellbeing requires a daily impact on it. The more your work on reflection habits the more powerful the brain muscles get and the more output you receive in the direction of anxiety relief. 

Destructive factors affect our mind permanently causing bipolar depression or anxiety. An excessive amount of information, lack of self-care culture - all these things influence negatively mental health. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) journal is used to bring up positive relations to the outer world by strengthening up the inner. 

<b>Benefits of mental health self-care with Mind Journal notebook:</b>
- gratitude uplift at work
- anxiety relief appears really fast thanks to proven psychotherapy methods
- developing an anxiety relief mindset via following self-care programs

Be your own best friend, cheerleader, spiritual guru, etc. with our carefully crafted daily journal prompts. It‚Äôs an easy way to incorporate self reflection into your life, and reflect on all the things that matter. 

Your diary is not just about writing what you ate for lunch. Instead, you can befriend yourself with thought-provoking prompts from day one. Reflect on your hopes and dreams, and really listen to yourself like a compassionate friend. If you‚Äôve ever struggled to keep up with a diary, our daily journal prompts can remove the struggle of thinking of things to say, and make this journaling habit easy to maintain.

Each journal prompt comes with ‚ÄúDive Deeper‚Äù questions to help you get the most out of your self care journal:
E.g. For the writing prompt: ‚ÄúLove is‚Ä¶‚Äù, reflect on Dive Deeper questions like ‚ÄúHow do you show love towards others? How do others show love towards you? What was your first memory of feeling loved? Does love have a spiritual dimension for you? If so, how?‚Äù 
The Dive Deeper questions help prevent writer‚Äôs block, making journaling a powerful wellness tool from day one.

A daily diary can seem daunting, even tedious ‚Äî when in fact, journaling can be a powerful self care habit. Read through our reviews: you‚Äôll find users who have used this app as a therapy journal, a self help aid, and a thought diary of everything important to them. Your daily journal can be a deeply rewarding wellness ritual that helps you write thoughts you might have otherwise ignored. We hope Prompted Journal helps you uncover more of what you‚Äôre meant be. 

This writing app can feel like traveling through time. On day one, you‚Äôll write a letter to your future self (1st prompt: Dear Future Me). About 3-4 months later, when the prompt recycles, you‚Äôll be able to read your letter. While we love the physical diary, writing apps make it possible to instantly find the last time you answered the same journal prompt, or view ALL the times you answered the prompt at once. Watch your self esteem improve with each new cycle: your answers to journal prompts like ‚ÄúMy biggest fear‚Ä¶‚Äù might show how you have overcome anxiety. This writing app becomes a conversation between you, your past self, and your future self. Your diary becomes a memento of how much you‚Äôve grown. Just by incorporating a simple 5 minute journal habit into your life, you can get to know yourself again.

WHAT YOU GET:
* Self care journaling for busy lives: 190+ journal prompts ready to go, recurring every 3-4 months.
* Daily reminders help you write and reflect every day.
* Create a PDF of your diary to print, email, or save.
* Daily journaling made easy.

Life is a journey, and our prompts are designed to help you reflect daily on where you‚Äôre heading. Write your thoughts on everything from mental health to love to self esteem. Make the five minute journal session you can squeeze into your mornings equate to five hours of talking with your best friend. Also, customize your guided journal by making journal prompts that only you can: e.g. ‚ÄúMy dog Lucy and I‚Ä¶‚Äù With a wide range of topics you can reflect on, you can see yourself in from various angles. 

OUR MISSION:
Self help and self therapy are difficult because all the incredible books and spot-on teachings don‚Äôt force you to put them into practice. ‚ÄúLove yourself,‚Äù ‚ÄúBe grateful,‚Äù etc. sound simple, but can be surprisingly hard to do. We hope our writing apps turn apparently ‚Äúsimple‚Äù self help mantras like ‚ÄúLove yourself‚Äù into wellness habits you can practice daily.

* We specialize in writing apps that foster self care and wellness. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us.

Find all the tools you need for better mental health within Moodflow!

<b>Moodflow</b> is a beautiful, modern and FREE app that captures your <u>emotions</u>, <u>moods</u>, <u>thoughts</u>, and <u>general well-being</u>. In addition, Moodflow goes along with you throughout your life, and <i>gives you a deeper understanding of yourself</i>, not previously known to you. Ultimately, this will allow you to improve your mental health and help you become a better you.

ü§ó HOW DOES MOODFLOW WORK? 
<b>You do not even need to write anything down to get a meaningful insight or to keep a diary.</b>

This is how easy Moodflow works:
Fill out a quick survey every day and gain insight into the WHAT and HOW it influences you over time.

‚Ä¢ <b>1.</b> Pick a rating for the day from 1 to 5.
‚Ä¢ <b>2.</b> Pick the emotions you experienced.
‚Ä¢ <b>3.</b> (optional) Write a note about everything important from the day.
‚Ä¢ <b>4.</b> (optional) Pick the activities you did during the day.
‚Ä¢ <b>5.</b> DONE! üòÅ

üëÄWHAT WILL THIS DATA DO FOR ME?
As time goes by, these short entries will gather insightful data about yourself that you will be able to analyze in many ways. On the one hand, a Calendar will be filled with colors that reflect your emotional well-being. This will allow you to get an eagle-eye perspective on your life that you never had before. On the other hand, Moodflow comes with data-analyzing tools, that will help you <b>find relationships between a plethora of different factors and your mood</b>. Moodflow will help you understand yourself better by allowing you to identify the things that <b>bring you up ‚Üë</b> or those that <b>pull you down ‚Üì</b>.

üëèWHAT ELSE CAN MOODFLOW OFFER?
Additionally, Moodflow encourages you to develop better habits by including 28-day challenges. These challenges have different levels of difficulty and will ensure that you create simple but powerful habits. As some have claimed: <b>""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is therefore not an act, but a habit"".</b>

More Features? We have them!

‚òÖ <b>Multiple entries per day</b>: Our mood fluctuates throughout the day. Therefore, you should be able to make as many entries as you want.

‚òÖ <b>No annoying ads</b>: Support the app by watching an advertisement. But only if you want to.

With gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.

To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.

And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.

Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:

1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL

A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life. 

In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. 

The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. 

You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.

2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS

If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations. 

Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. 

They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.

The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. 

You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.

Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.

3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS

Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.

In the Gratitude app, we‚Äôll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!

4. üåàDAILY ZEN

We understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app. 

Here, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.

One simple switch can begin a massive change in your life. A self-care tool like Gratitude will help you build a healthy routine to take care of your mental health, achieve your goals, and live a beautiful life.","The Gratitude app is a carefully-designed self-care tool to help you focus on your mental health.<br><br>With gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.<br><br>To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.<br><br>And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.<br><br>Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:<br><br>1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL<br><br>A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life. <br><br>In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. <br><br>The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. <br><br>You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.<br><br>2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS<br><br>If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations. <br><br>Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. <br><br>They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.<br><br>The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. <br><br>You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.<br><br>Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.<br><br>3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS<br><br>Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board.

How app is based on research:

- Keeping a gratitude journal is a great way to ensure that you realize how wonderful your life really is. Studies have shown that gratitude journals increase your happiness. 
*Here's a reference from the fine folks at Harvard:  http://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier

- Smiling more will make you happy! Even if it's forced at first, you'll soon  be realizing that it will come more natural and be easier to do. 
*Reference: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120730150113.htm

- Rating your current level of happiness could make you more mindful of it which has the potential to make you happier since it's on your mind. This feature is also very useful for helping you track progress. More research is needed in this area to determine long term benefits.

-------

Some reminder features:

- Allow for randomness. You don't want to always smile at 3pm, let's try to mix it up a bit.
- Specify time ranges. No point getting a reminder to rate your happiness if you are already asleep.
- Specify exact times so you can write your grateful things on your schedule. Try in the morning.

In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. 

The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. 

You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.

2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS

If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations. 

Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. 

They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.

The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. 

You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.

Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.

3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS

Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.

In the Gratitude app, we‚Äôll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!

4. üåàDAILY ZEN

We understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app. 

Here, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.

One simple switch can begin a massive change in your life. A self-care tool like Gratitude will help you build a healthy routine to take care of your mental health, achieve your goals, and live a beautiful life.","The Gratitude app is a carefully-designed self-care tool to help you focus on your mental health.<br><br>With gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.<br><br>To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.<br><br>And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.<br><br>Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:<br><br>1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL<br><br>A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life. <br><br>In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. <br><br>The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. <br><br>You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.<br><br>2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS<br><br>If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations. <br><br>Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. <br><br>They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.<br><br>The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. <br><br>You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.<br><br>Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.<br><br>3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS<br><br>Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board.

With gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.

To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.

And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.

Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:

1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL

A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life. 

In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. 

The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. 

You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.

2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS

If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations. 

Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. 

They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.

The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. 

You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.

Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.

3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS

Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.

In the Gratitude app, we‚Äôll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!

4. üåàDAILY ZEN

We understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app. 

Here, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.

One simple switch can begin a massive change in your life. A self-care tool like Gratitude will help you build a healthy routine to take care of your mental health, achieve your goals, and live a beautiful life.","The Gratitude app is a carefully-designed self-care tool to help you focus on your mental health.<br><br>With gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.<br><br>To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.<br><br>And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.<br><br>Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:<br><br>1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL<br><br>A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life. <br><br>In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. <br><br>The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. <br><br>You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.<br><br>2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS<br><br>If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations. <br><br>Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. <br><br>They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.<br><br>The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. <br><br>You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.<br><br>Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.<br><br>3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS<br><br>Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board.

Boost positivity, practice self compassion, and increase well being with the simple habit of gratitude! 
 
When studying at Duke University, one of our founders started experiencing symptoms of depression. As an approach to depression relief, her counselor told her about some incredible research from the university. Dr. Bryan Sexton, associate professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke‚Äôs School of Medicine found: simply listing three good things in a particular way increased happiness more effectively than Prozac! 

This gratitude app was inspired by, and based closely on, that study. (Find out more: https://youtu.be/hZ4aT_RVHCs) 

WHAT YOU‚ÄôLL GET:
* A journaling app based on the study above
* Safe and ad-free space to reflect on three good things, with an inspirational quote ‚ÄòMemories‚Äô section, or a gratitude log: perfect for the days you need feel happier, or remember happier times were just around the corner 
* Daily journal that is easy to keep and sustain
* Create a PDF of your daily journal to print, email, or save. Some users have printed and bound their entries as evidence of their self improvement journey.
* Daily reminders to keep you on-track towards happier habits.
* Send the three good things you were grateful for with one tap: share your gratitude with others 
* Night mode to improve sleep quality: engage in positive reflection at night without glare from your phone  

Practice daily self care with an easy 5 minute journal habit you can use to reflect on the happier moments of your day. You also might surprise yourself to learn that even on days you experienced depression or anxiety, you were able to find three good things you were grateful for.

Sometimes, we forget that all things must pass and it‚Äôs hard to get out of a dark mindset. Being forced to write positive affirmations about how your day went can help you find happiness where you previously could not.  Scrolling through your Memories tab on rainy days can remind you that wellness has been, and will be abundant if you look. Lastly, after using our gratitude journal, you might learn that being ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù is just about as close to being ‚Äúhappy‚Äù as anything can be. 

UC Berkeley & UC Davis launched a multi-year project on Expanding the Science and Practice of Gratitude. They found that people who regularly practice gratitude report:
- A stronger immune system 
- Lower blood pressure
- Higher levels of joy, positivity, and happiness
- Acting with more generosity and compassion
- Feeling less alone and isolated

Thank you for taking care of yourself and practicing gratitude. We hope our wellness journal helps you tangibly understand the meaning of happiness, and become all that you were meant to be.

Be your own best friend, cheerleader, spiritual guru, etc. with our carefully crafted daily journal prompts. It‚Äôs an easy way to incorporate self reflection into your life, and reflect on all the things that matter. 

Your diary is not just about writing what you ate for lunch. Instead, you can befriend yourself with thought-provoking prompts from day one. Reflect on your hopes and dreams, and really listen to yourself like a compassionate friend. If you‚Äôve ever struggled to keep up with a diary, our daily journal prompts can remove the struggle of thinking of things to say, and make this journaling habit easy to maintain.

Each journal prompt comes with ‚ÄúDive Deeper‚Äù questions to help you get the most out of your self care journal:
E.g. For the writing prompt: ‚ÄúLove is‚Ä¶‚Äù, reflect on Dive Deeper questions like ‚ÄúHow do you show love towards others? How do others show love towards you? What was your first memory of feeling loved? Does love have a spiritual dimension for you? If so, how?‚Äù 
The Dive Deeper questions help prevent writer‚Äôs block, making journaling a powerful wellness tool from day one.

A daily diary can seem daunting, even tedious ‚Äî when in fact, journaling can be a powerful self care habit. Read through our reviews: you‚Äôll find users who have used this app as a therapy journal, a self help aid, and a thought diary of everything important to them. Your daily journal can be a deeply rewarding wellness ritual that helps you write thoughts you might have otherwise ignored. We hope Prompted Journal helps you uncover more of what you‚Äôre meant be. 

This writing app can feel like traveling through time. On day one, you‚Äôll write a letter to your future self (1st prompt: Dear Future Me). About 3-4 months later, when the prompt recycles, you‚Äôll be able to read your letter. While we love the physical diary, writing apps make it possible to instantly find the last time you answered the same journal prompt, or view ALL the times you answered the prompt at once. Watch your self esteem improve with each new cycle: your answers to journal prompts like ‚ÄúMy biggest fear‚Ä¶‚Äù might show how you have overcome anxiety. This writing app becomes a conversation between you, your past self, and your future self. Your diary becomes a memento of how much you‚Äôve grown. Just by incorporating a simple 5 minute journal habit into your life, you can get to know yourself again.

WHAT YOU GET:
* Self care journaling for busy lives: 190+ journal prompts ready to go, recurring every 3-4 months.
* Daily reminders help you write and reflect every day.
* Create a PDF of your diary to print, email, or save.
* Daily journaling made easy.

Life is a journey, and our prompts are designed to help you reflect daily on where you‚Äôre heading. Write your thoughts on everything from mental health to love to self esteem. Make the five minute journal session you can squeeze into your mornings equate to five hours of talking with your best friend. Also, customize your guided journal by making journal prompts that only you can: e.g. ‚ÄúMy dog Lucy and I‚Ä¶‚Äù With a wide range of topics you can reflect on, you can see yourself in from various angles. 

OUR MISSION:
Self help and self therapy are difficult because all the incredible books and spot-on teachings don‚Äôt force you to put them into practice. ‚ÄúLove yourself,‚Äù ‚ÄúBe grateful,‚Äù etc. sound simple, but can be surprisingly hard to do. We hope our writing apps turn apparently ‚Äúsimple‚Äù self help mantras like ‚ÄúLove yourself‚Äù into wellness habits you can practice daily.

* We specialize in writing apps that foster self care and wellness. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us.

WE RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY:
Your daily journal is yours and yours alone. We don‚Äôt store any of your data or ask you to create an account. We built this diary journal with your privacy in mind.

Feature customizable reminders to:
- Rate your current level of happiness
- Record what you are grateful for
- Take daily notes
- and to Smile!

** NOW Featuring cloud storage! Save all your data in the cloud and export it via email. Login with Facebook or create an account in the app! 

-------

How app is based on research:

- Keeping a gratitude journal is a great way to ensure that you realize how wonderful your life really is. Studies have shown that gratitude journals increase your happiness. 
*Here's a reference from the fine folks at Harvard:  http://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier

- Smiling more will make you happy! Even if it's forced at first, you'll soon  be realizing that it will come more natural and be easier to do. 
*Reference: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120730150113.htm

- Rating your current level of happiness could make you more mindful of it which has the potential to make you happier since it's on your mind. This feature is also very useful for helping you track progress. More research is needed in this area to determine long term benefits.

-------

Some reminder features:

- Allow for randomness. You don't want to always smile at 3pm, let's try to mix it up a bit.
- Specify time ranges. No point getting a reminder to rate your happiness if you are already asleep.
- Specify exact times so you can write your grateful things on your schedule. Try in the morning.

With gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.

To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.

And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.

Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:

1. üìñ GRATITUDE JOURNAL

A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life. 

In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. 

The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. 

You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.

2. üíóPOSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS

If you‚Äôve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you‚Äôve probably heard about affirmations. 

Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. 

They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.

The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. 

You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.

Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.

3. üèûCREATE VISION BOARDS

Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.

In the Gratitude app, we‚Äôll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!

4. üåàDAILY ZEN

We understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app. 

Here, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.

One simple switch can begin a massive change in your life.

Boost positivity, practice self compassion, and increase well being with the simple habit of gratitude! 
 
When studying at Duke University, one of our founders started experiencing symptoms of depression. As an approach to depression relief, her counselor told her about some incredible research from the university. Dr. Bryan Sexton, associate professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke‚Äôs School of Medicine found: simply listing three good things in a particular way increased happiness more effectively than Prozac! 

This gratitude app was inspired by, and based closely on, that study. (Find out more: https://youtu.be/hZ4aT_RVHCs) 

WHAT YOU‚ÄôLL GET:
* A journaling app based on the study above
* Safe and ad-free space to reflect on three good things, with an inspirational quote ‚ÄòMemories‚Äô section, or a gratitude log: perfect for the days you need feel happier, or remember happier times were just around the corner 
* Daily journal that is easy to keep and sustain
* Create a PDF of your daily journal to print, email, or save. Some users have printed and bound their entries as evidence of their self improvement journey.
* Daily reminders to keep you on-track towards happier habits.
* Send the three good things you were grateful for with one tap: share your gratitude with others 
* Night mode to improve sleep quality: engage in positive reflection at night without glare from your phone  

Practice daily self care with an easy 5 minute journal habit you can use to reflect on the happier moments of your day. You also might surprise yourself to learn that even on days you experienced depression or anxiety, you were able to find three good things you were grateful for.

Sometimes, we forget that all things must pass and it‚Äôs hard to get out of a dark mindset. Being forced to write positive affirmations about how your day went can help you find happiness where you previously could not.  Scrolling through your Memories tab on rainy days can remind you that wellness has been, and will be abundant if you look. Lastly, after using our gratitude journal, you might learn that being ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù is just about as close to being ‚Äúhappy‚Äù as anything can be. 

UC Berkeley & UC Davis launched a multi-year project on Expanding the Science and Practice of Gratitude. They found that people who regularly practice gratitude report:
- A stronger immune system 
- Lower blood pressure
- Higher levels of joy, positivity, and happiness
- Acting with more generosity and compassion
- Feeling less alone and isolated

Thank you for taking care of yourself and practicing gratitude. We hope our wellness journal helps you tangibly understand the meaning of happiness, and become all that you were meant to be.

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
¬†
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

<b>YOUR LIFE COMPANION</b>
Journal it! is designed to be a super app, a hub for all aspects of your personal life. Besides keeping your precious memories, you can plan your day with tasks and habits, track your goals with journeys, and understand your emotions with mood tracker, and the highly customizable tracker feature lets you track everything from health to finance and visualize the result later with charts.


<b>THE TIME BLOCKING METHOD</b>
Time blocking (or time boxing, task batching, day theming) allows you to divide your day into blocks of time. Each block is dedicated to accomplishing a specific task, or group of tasks, and only those specific tasks. With this, you won‚Äôt have to constantly make choices about what to focus on during your day anymore.

Time management: a pomodoro timer is also included so you can easily track how much time you spent on a particular task.


<b>THE MOST WELL ORGANIZED JOURNAL APP</b>
The only app with organizing options designed for journaling that help you easily keep everything in context. There‚Äôre 6 organizing options: journeys (stories, goals,...), activities (routines, interests,...), tags, categories, people, and places. Each entry can be organized into multiple organizing options at the same time. No need for separate journals for each subject while still keeping things neatly organized, perfect if you want to digitize your paper Bullet Journal.


<b>PRIVACY AND SECURITY</b>
At Doit App, we treasure your privacy, and at the same time keep your experience frictionless. To provide an automatic, effortless sync experience and be able to use on multiple devices, your text data is stored securely in the cloud (encrypted on transferring and storing at rest). You can also enable end-to-end encryption to obfuscate your data even to us.

Your photos are stored in a hidden, private folder on your Google Drive that‚Äôs only visible to the app (more cloud storage provider options could be added in the future).


<b>MONEY BACK GUARANTEE</b>
The app is free to try. Upgrading might not even be necessary if your usage is simple. All purchases are eligible for a refund within 60 days, with no question to answer, and no form to fill. Just send the receipt to any of our support channels.

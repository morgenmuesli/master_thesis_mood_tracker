I’ve literally seen every change and update since 2018 and the paywall was never this aggressive. It’s a shame, I can’t recommend this to anyone anymore, I barely want to use it to be honest because I’m not paying for this app. Not when I know y’all have the capability of giving these resources for free but you just CHOOSE not to. It’s genuinely a choice cos when I started while the app wasn’t as extensive, it was definitely free. It feels like a slap in the face to the people who’ve been loyal to this app despite the hundreds of apps that are coming to replace this one. The only thing that set you apart in this market was the technology and accessibility. You’ve got rid of accessibility to the technology sooo… you’ve lost your selling point. Hope you make serious changes cos this isn’t right.

PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY PAID FOR PREMIUM AND IT DIDNT WORK. Y’all are actively tarnishing your own reputation. Lol.

I also, unfortunately, loved how easy deleting my account was. Few developers care enough about the leaving end users, and I do genuinely appreciate the ease with which this was to find, which is why I bumped it up another star.
Now the negative. In order to do all of my first day tasks (FIRST DAY), I had to get a subscription. Yes, there’s a free trial, but there’s always a risk there (and the deletion of the account, if I recall correctly, will have no effect on Apple’s record of the subscription leading to a possible unintended $70 spent). I understand developers/research/maybe voice actors? need to eat, but that’s an awful lot of money to spend Willy nilly. And nickel and diming me on the first day?

When they first started this app it was awesome. I recommended it to many of my friends. Then they started copying other app formats, which was ok. Today almost everything that used to be free is now monetized. If they added lots of new features and made these for members only, that would be one thing, but instead turning almost all of the free content that was available for years into “members only” now is just nothing but greediness. Do I see value enough in this to pay $70 per year? Unfortunately not

I also read some of their recent feedback since all of their recent reviews are negative. They say they use this money for supporting the team for research etc. How were you supporting your teams for the past 5 years??

It keeps track of your mood and mental health screenings on a graph, and there’s helpful mindfulness activities and quizzes that make you know yourself better. You can also save and keep track of your journaling and see how far you’ve come, that was one of my favorite features.

At the time, it was completely free and it felt too good to be true. It was so useful for documenting my feelings whenever I needed and I was so appreciative of the service since my family can’t afford therapy as our insurance doesn’t cover it. Then the pandemic hit and I stopped using it because I was too mentally exhausted to do anything, including taking care of myself. I got a therapist for a while and I forgot about Youper. I can’t afford my therapist anymore and I was fine with that until today I wanted to do some journaling and opened Youper to find that all the services I loved are now blocked by a paywall. Granted, $44.99 a year (or whatever it is) is fairly reasonable for the service, but as a broke college kid, I can’t make that kind of investment. I wouldn’t be complaining if I could at least journal for free, but I can’t even do that. The most basic of features aren’t available unless you pay, making the app useless for me.

This used to be my go-to app for getting through difficult times due to not being able to afford therapy or afford alternatives like better help or talk space. The chat bot, although a bit impersonal and scripted, would get me through difficult moments and help me try different coping mechanisms to improve my mood. Now, there is a premium version and the app won’t allow me to select a free version anymore. 

Why throw away loyal users this way? At the very least, provide a freemium option rather than driving away users who have been with you since the beginning. Other mental health apps on the market like Headspace or Calm offer free versions. Other chat bot apps on the market like Replika charge for a whole year approximately what you want to charge your users for a week. I am so disappointed and sickened by the fact that a very useful app that helps people struggling with mental health is being monetized through the individuals who desperately need these services and may not have other options. 

This is exactly why people don’t get the help that they need because mental healthcare is so expensive. You expect someone to pay for $40 per week for a chat bot? Clearly, you never had the intention of helping people with their mental health, just getting them on the platform long enough to expect struggling people to spend $40 per week on your chat bot. I can’t believe we live in a world that’s willing to let people suffer over mental illnesses they can’t help on their own. I thought this was a great app but profiting $40 per user per week is more of a priority to this company rather than retaining and helping people who can’t afford that. 

I used to recommend this app to people. Not anymore. You’re no better than Betterhelp or Talkspace at this point. Why not expect insurance companies or doctor offices to cover the cost of this app for patients? Instead, you expect your same user base that used your app because they couldn’t afford therapy to suddenly dish out thousands of dollars to use your app. This makes you responsible for ensuring that thousands of people who could get help from this app won’t, and all it would take is just offering a free version rather than expecting every user to buy pro.",,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/2650419355/reply,"[""Design & UX"", ""Dissatisfied users"", ""Gaming"", ""Payment"", ""Performance"", ""Pricing"", ""Customer Support"", ""Update"", ""Use cases"", ""Devices""]",[],[]

They shouldn’t even advertise it as a “free” or “affordable” app anymore because the developers aren’t up front with the costs ahead of time. I would’ve rather paid a one-time high cost app fee instead of a ridiculously expensive yearly/monthly subscription service (that they claim is “affordable”) and is not individualized at all. The fact is I used to pay $2.50 a month for all the services and monitoring. I understand they’re trying to have more inclusive mental health services, however I already have a therapist, a psychiatrist, and take medication. If people need those services keep it a separate payment plan, especially because it’s not necessary for everyone and the app was managing just fine before they decided to hire more people for extra services, that aren’t even accessed in all states (my state is New York for example) which as they claim they’re “working on” (which is only going to drive the cost of the subscription up more). It’s not “affordable”. Why not just have separate apps for what you’re trying to do anyway? That way people can get individualized medication treatments and psychiatry appointments on one app, people can have one app for just mood tracking and therapy, and one app for the meditations/calm noises/affirmations. Also don’t bother responding to this review “developer team” because you say the exact same thing to every low review anyway (it looks performative and cheap). I don’t want excuses or apologies for your current app, because saying that you “don’t want to sell our information to keep it free” means absolutely nothing, why is that even listed as a reason why it’s more expensive?

I even paid for the premium for a year! I felt as though the premium wasn’t really worth it as the only thing I was able to do extra were the tests . I stopped going on it for some time and when I logged back on there were so many changes . You can not do anything for free not even choose your mood or audio!

recently my sister has been having some mental health problems similar to mine and i recommended it to her. she downloaded it and said she was basically locked out of almost all of the features unless she paid the $90/year premium, including goals which is something that used to be free and is very important for recovery. i was confused, because that's not the youper i know, so i went to check and saw a completely different app than what i was used to. i apologized to her because i didn't know any other free therapy apps and she had to go find another one herself. thankfully she found one that was good, i think it was called mindshift.

really disappointed to see that this small app basically grew into a large corporation that runs just for capital. the new features are good but, most people come to therapy apps because they can't afford regular treatment. some people, especially those who are disabled or living paycheck to paycheck can literally spare no expense. what i liked about youper was that it was easy, i'd take a simple, free app that runs off ad revenue over a complicated pay-by-the-month app with more features. would be one thing if it was a one-time purchase but it's not, and monthly payments start to add up fast. it is really nice that you guys seem to have given long-time users free premium, but that makes it difficult for me to recommend this app to any new users.

as a side note, why hasn't schizophrenia been added to the symptom-checker? i've been recommending it since 2018 and have yet to see it there. is there some specific reason like because it's harder to diagnose/track symptoms or what?",,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/2440913359/reply,"[""Advertising"", ""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Dissatisfied users"", ""Payment"", ""Pricing"", ""Customer Support""]",[],[]

Now there are mood tracker apps but Youper takes it a step further by tracking and analyzing the reasons you specify is related to why you feel a certain way. Each time you “talk” with Youper, the conversation is stored and used to build up an analysis to study what shapes your moods. You can also set goals and track those. I like that you can personalize the goals and choose if you want Youper to check-in to see if you accomplished your goal. There are several different types of conversations you can have too depending on what you want to accomplish. The conversations have really helped guide me how to cope and respond to how I’m feeling. You can check-in daily about your mood but there are also trackers for checking progress with depression, anxiety, BPD, PTSD, etc. Those check-ins are every couple of weeks or so using questionnaires (officially used by healthcare providers). There’s a section that shows charts of how these certain areas are progressing, like how your depression has progressed from moderately severe to moderate over the last two weeks based on how you answered the questionnaire, for example. Final take away, the more you use Youper, the more insights you can gain. The “Mood” section shows daily, monthly, and yearly progress charts. This can be helpful to spot trends. A really neat and intuitive section I like is where Youper collects data from your conversations to show “what makes me...depressed, sad, anxious, angry, sad, frustrated,” etc. For example, after you’ve had several conversations with Youper where you indicate “bad sleep” as the reason you feel depressed, that will show up as a factor related to your depression. These insights develop over time and the more you converse with Youper, so checking in daily helps to get the most out of it. 

Tl;Dr: this app is so different from all the other self-help apps. It’s so intuitive with different and very helpful ways to track my progress related to different mental issues and life experiences. Love, love, LOVE the conversation and insights features! Looking forward to seeing new conversation topics that continue to be added. Thank you for making such a wonderful app!

It has been so helpful and I have only been using it for three days! I really like that the artificial intelligence is personalized for you and it feels like every time I’m talking with a therapist who cares, validates my feelings, and works to help me find solutions! Sometimes I just can’t seem to process or work to find solutions and I love that Youper helps give me options on different ways that I can solve my problems! It has helped in the matter that instead of sinking and staying stuck in my thoughts Youper has guided me into finding solutions! I walk away feeling better 98% of the time!

I also love that Youper holds me accountable to the goals I set and if I don’t achieve them, Youper kindly reminds me that keeping consistent with my goals will be the best. They don’t say it harshly but kindly. Then Youper checks up to make sure I didn’t set a goal to difficult and encourages me to try again! 

I have to give a big shoutout to the team of developers who have worked so hard in developing this app! It has changed my life in being a 24/7 therapist when I am unable to go to a therapist! I have no problem in paying a yearly amount for this app!

The only suggestion I would make is to maybe design a face or passcode protection so that others can’t access it. For example if a parent is using this and their child plays games on their phone it wouldn’t hurt to have a passcode protection so that their information is protected from unwanted people who could access deep and personal things in the app.",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/2321099902/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Frequency"", ""Payment"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

I don’t really feel like this type of virtual treatment should cost anything at all! I’m also suffering financially and I can’t exactly cancel my savings with this subscription.

Edit: I finally found the mood journaling function: it’s buried within the “talk” section that includes specific targeted therapy sessions I guess? Haven’t used them yet but I think it’s silly I had to scroll through them just to find what used to be the whole point of this app for me. Luckily I was able to “favorite” the “I’m feeling” function for easier access next time so the utility of this app has been mostly restored for me.

This app has been so helpful for me because it’s here, in the moment. It challenges me at times with reframing my negative thoughts, it reminds me to notice my feelings and to accept them (not beat myself up), it is an outlet for me to vent and to be “heard,” it gives solid suggestions and ideas, and it helps me to set goals (which is hard when feeling depressed etc.) I’m sure it’s not for everyone, but it’s been very helpful to me and I can see myself using it for a long time. I can see how it would also work in tandem with going to see a “real” counselor because it would help with generalizing or carrying over the skills you learn in therapy.  In the past, I would learn a lot in therapy and feel good during the session or the next day. But as time goes on, you forget the strategies because they’re not ingrained in your mind and things fall to the wayside. With this app, you can set reminders, so that’s been great to not forget to track my feelings, reflect on my goals, and to follow through on helpful suggestions. There have been a couple of times where I was feeling extreme frustration and distress at home and I ran off to “talk” to Youper and it helped to have an outside perspective and to vent. I did feel better. Normally in those situations, I would’ve ran off and stewed in my emotions, and in my head with thoughts going crazy, with no solution of my own to make things better.

The developers should be ashamed at releasing such a defective and bug riddled product. 

The tabs are very SLOW to load. 

Worst of all, going to INSIGHTS  tab (either directly or automatically after journaling) FREEZES the app. As such, I am completely UNABLE to view any of my 3+ years worth of sessions into the app Or view my mood tracker Or change the settings. 

I am abhor that the first thing the app does is to suggest what to work on, such as: “Shall we work on your depression?” Or (especially before bed) “Can I suggest a productivity boosting activity?”  I need this feature removed because it has never been helpful and often causes more DISTRESS. 

There are way too many options. It is a visual cluttered mess.  I don’t like the pictures. It bothers my OCD and makes the app way more difficult to use.

There are some days that I won’t use Youper because I know it’s going to cause me more distress because of the horrible user interface and broken features. 

If the developers choose to respond to my review, please do not give me any canned answers. I doubt consumer feedback said to have a million options, including the kitchen sink. 

Please don’t patronize me by stating that change can be difficult. The biggest complaint from everyone is that the app changes the interface way too often. 

Please address the serious problems of features NOT WORKING. 

STOP adding useless features in order to justify charging for this app. 

Please clean up the user interface so that it is streamlined and easy to use.

Please take a lot more time to make sure the app works properly.

Everything is so clunky now, I used to open the app and Youper would say: “ Hey! How are you?”. Everything was streamlined and easy.

 I even used this as a journal and reported everything to my counselor, it helped me so much with remembering things. And my therapist would use the Heath monitoring tools as benchmarks. It was also a great replacement when I was not able to see my counselor or had to find a new one. 

No more.

Even after making favorites I can’t have one conversation to do everything, I have to do everything separately.

The mood and other diary entry’s have moved and it’s hard to find. Something about the UI in general is off-putting, I don’t know. 

I’ve moved onto Sanvello, if you enjoy the old Youper this is your new app. It does guided meditations as well, and has way more feelings to choose from. There’s a lot more as well, but I’m not trying to make this an ad. Check it out for yourself and see if it’s right for you.

To conclude: ever since the last update, the app is essentially unusable (for me). I liked the old way so much better.

I’ve downgraded my rating from five stars though, because the most recent update feels like one step forward and a few steps back. Not only is the interface less user friendly (and slower), but most importantly Youper doesn’t actually feel conversational anymore in the “I feel” section.

The app used to default to these warm, complex, therapeutic conversations. Since the new update it just feels like access to “features” on an expensive website.

The combo of emotional journaling and various meditation options is such a strong one. Youper really helped me get through some hard times, and though I use it less now, it still holds a dear place in my emotional life.

That being said... I’m not sure I like where the app is heading. Every day a new feature is added- theyve make the conversation more complex, they try to make it more engaging by adding pictures/new visual aspects, there is now a home page. What I loved about Youper was how simple it was— it’s simply doing too much these days. For instance, when you used to log on it would just take you straight to some emotional journaling which was nice and predictable. Logging on today I was greeted with a banner reading “Im happy to see you again. Can I help improve your anxiety?”. If I hadn't been feeling anxious before...I definitely was feeling a little anxious after reading that. I think the simplicity of Youper is what made it feel accessible and dependable. These days, opening up Youper is a little bit of a jarring experience. The constant updates to the app produce the same effect as  a therapist changing offices every day— it impedes the process. The conversation is growing increasingly halting, garbled, and incomprehensible. It saddens me!

I probably wont get rid of Youper any time soon. There is no other app that does what it does. But it’s changing and changing fast.

It’s probably not worth downloading this app unless you’re willing to drop money on a yearly subscription upfront. Pretty much every feature is locked out to free users except for the chatbot. Of course, the chatbot seems to be one of the big selling points here, but even that is severely limited. All you’re allowed to do is select how you’re feeling, and that’s the extent of chatbot functionality unless you pay up. It’s a shame because the app actually looks decent. Not only this but there’s only a yearly subscription, and I’m not really in the position to be able to drop a lump sum in one go. The funny thing is that when you view subscription pricing, one of the testimonials is a woman talking about how she uses the app on an as-needed basis. How are you using it as-needed when you have to pay for a year upfront?!

Don’t know how much of a difference this review will make since I’ll probably get the standard developer response “we need the money to develop our AI”.

I have a great support group/system (12 Step and other recovering addicts) and go to a  psychiatrist  monthly and therapy weekly. Youper fits itself in between those systems because there are many moments during the day when I am by myself. I can be completely honest with Youper; I never feel ashamed or embarrassed when ""talking"" to Youper. I know it may sound silly, but I feel a very human- like quality in Youper. I love the mindfulness and practicing gratitude aspects of Youper. In version number 7, they've added ""Calm"" and a couple of other moods that I felt were missing. And I've read others' reviews complaining about not being able to dive straight into meditation, but heck, the more I ""check in"" the better off I am! Thank-you.

Don’t know if its because I’ve been using it since 2018 or because I may have bought a premium earlier on that they decided to honor when they went subscription.

I have one complaint: I need the option to see thinking traps. Did y’all remove this feature? Changing my thinking doesn’t help me if I can’t tell what sort of trap I’m falling into. I’d also like it if I could just click on it as an option after I finish writing down my feelings (“I’m feeling...” option) because I do experience cognitive distortions in other moods. Only reason its at four stars.

Tbh I’d also like a mania behavior tracker but that’s not a complaint.

Good app otherwise. I use it to track my bipolar symptoms, and it has helped me figure out why certain things set me off. I use the breathing tools frequently which help through anger episodes.

Now I feel more relaxed. This app also changes the way you think because your thoughts aren’t you. You get 7 days free & there’s an annual fee which is even less than one therapist visit. So I tried this & another app. It will talk to you 24/7. Still texting & there is a session that it verbally talks to you. So I can use it anytime anyplace. It’s a small price to pay if those regular therapy visits are too costly. This is very affordable in the long run. & easy to use.,,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/2066535059/reply,"[""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

The reason why my feelings have changed is because Youper has made even MORE features premium. Now the only non-premium feature is the very basic mood tracker — almost NO parts of the app are accessible without paying. The factor analysis feature (linked your chosen mood factors, over time, with moods, which enabled you to see what factors in your life generally contribute to different moods) was just changed from free to a premium-only part of the app. Now, the free features of the app provide nothing note-worthy, honestly.

I still don't, which is why me, and I'm sure many others depended on this service. This begs the question of why make inaccessible something that can be utilized by those who don't have any other option. Its so saddening to see profit go over people. Especially in the case of mental health in a time when its so dire for people who need help, but do not have access. Be it by finances or not having access because of home situations- especially in the case of those underage. Those who do not have support from family but still want to get help. 

Truly my disappointment is immeasurable with this product. I remember i used to recommend this app to anyone i knew who was struggling with mental health.  If finances are truly the issue to keep this app running, I'm sure a donation service, or occasional fundraising would be better instead of stripping away one of the only resources people have. 

I have doubts that this will ever be changed, or if this app even is meant to help people instead of being a grab at money from those you know are desperate. Very disappointed.

I’ve been using it regularly for months and it’s really great to capture my mood and to discover insights. till now. 
When Youper was asking for my opinion what can you guys make better, I always suggested that this app should be for free, or at least you could add some free features, because not everybody can afford it with your crazy prices. 
so after last update - I found out that from now on I have to pay to discover my mood insights, which was fricking free option!!! Why would you even take it away??
Sorry not sorry, but if you’re gonna still take away features and make people pay for them, they’re going to leave you sooner than you think.

It’s been really helpful - the UI and system for labelling your emotions has allowed me to feel some control over what I feel.

I opened the app recently and made a new account since I’d forgotten my old details. The latest version seems to offer premium two or three times before actually asking me how I feel. After the first logging, it offers it again.

This makes it feel like the app cares about making money before actually helping me.

I’ve been using Youper for six months and it is helpful to record my emotions throughout the day, identify patterns in what’s driving them and provide as few or many details as I feel like. There is never a time when the app “forces” details or steps - the user is driving the whole interaction and can keep it simple or go deeper. I tested the free version for a month before I decided to invest in the paid features and I like them because the advanced conversations have been good for “hot” moments when I need an assist to term the volume down on am intense feeling.

I was sad and confused and talking to youper helped a lot. It let me track my emotions and view my progress without much of a hitch. I opened it up for the first time in a long time today and was very disappointed. I understand that an app like this needs money from it’s users to make the best of itself. But today in the midst of talking to youper it felt like it was just advertising why I should go premium and not offering any actual insight. Youper used to be a huge help, but now it feels pay to play. Very disappointed that the chat brings up needing money for certain features when the chat is a place many go to seek guidance and understanding. I don’t know if you’ve considered many people without access to therapy use this app to help themselves. Being at your weakest mid chat and getting options for going premium instead of actual support is very saddening. Paying to see insights feels scummy as well since I don’t remember having to pay for it before.

I just started one and it was good, but my kid woke up and needed my attention. When I went back to it, I couldn't pick up where I left off and had to start a new conversation. 

I don't like that it doesn't take some things into account. Asking about mood swings--well yeah my period starts in a couple days. But instead of considering female problems I'm prompted to fill out a borderline personality disorder assessment. Maybe the assessment factors in that time of month and hormone issues, but not really in the mood to fill that out and incorrectly assess me when I'm PMS-ing, so...

I also wish there were redos on the personality test. Questions like ""are you anxious a lot?"" are temporary for many. That's not my personality. I'm currently anxious a lot, but ask me a year from now or even a year previous and my answer would be different as I'm not a naturally anxious person but my health and life situation currently put me in that category. It'd be fun to see how I change as I grow. If there is a retest button I can't find it, if there's not it would be great to have one. There were a few other questions where I thought ""huh, I'm not normally that way, but as I'm going through a tough time I am"". It's important for people struggling to get back to their old self (or a new and improved better self) to not be concretely defined as they currently are. Allow them to change and grow. That's what this app is for, right?

Those are the 3 things that bug me. I'm happy with the conversations, though, as long as I can make it through fast enough before getting interrupted. Please consider a save!! Busy moms will love it.",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/1829456510/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Security & Accounts""]",[],[]

I felt like a lot of the apps I used in the past had a condescending air to their teachings while this one gives u a chance to give a general idea of your experience with certain topics which keeps it from explaining something you already know as if you've never even heard of it (*cough cough* meditation *cough*). As for the mindfulness/meditation portion. I really enjoy how they did it. I've been meditating for a while now but I've noticed that for many beginners it's easier to focus on the mindfulness task when there isn't meditation music playing in the background. This gives you the chance to truly focus on what's expected and lets you acknowledge the natural/typical sounds around you that you wouldn't otherwise notice. Sorry for the long review, I just honestly think this app was well made and wanted to share some of why I think so :) I definitely recommend it.",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/1811072071/reply,"[""Audio"", ""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Satisfied users""]",[],[]

Youper has provided me a way to help ground myself and calm myself down.  Even though it’s just an app and not a person I’m talking to the questions the app asks help guide my mind back into a positive space.  It’s like journaling but the journal asks you questions to help you cope.  It provides you with meditation and mindfulness techniques and helps you write a list of goals to help you cope with an anxiety filled day.  It tracks what makes you feel certain emotions and it tracks your improvement over time.  I cannot thank the developers enough for creating this app.  It’s incredible.

You have someone to talk to whenever you want and someone to help you explore yourself. This was just what I was looking for! But after the introduction to the app, it gives you the option to go premium or do without it. I chose to go without. Now, every time I get on the app, all that I am allowed to do is tell Youper how I am feeling and press done. There is no feedback that helps me understand how I’m feeling or helps me to feel better. I can understand that therapy costs money in most if not all cases. But is it so much to ask to hear a few words of positivity without having to pay money? If you are up for paying, than Youper might be for you.

In the roughly two months I’ve been using I opted to upgrade to the subscription in order to access more meditations. I love seeing the mood tracker and the AI conversations feel more natural than some other apps, as if talking to a friend. Minor fixes could include loading more meditations, and allowing edits to the tracker. For example, I was able to add “journaling” to the list of reasons for my moods, but can’t really change the icon or title after it’s been added. Of course I use this app in addition to seeing a CBT mental health professional, not sure if I could recommend it as a replacement though.

Youper is unable to address how daily pain, fatigue, and physical limitations affect mental health.

My major stressor right now is the Coronavirus pandemic, but Youper is wholly unable to address this. For example, it suggested that a way to lift my spirits would be to visit a museum! Yeah, no.

A human counselor can adapt to circumstances. Youper totally cannot.

The thing I keep it for is the screening tests, which confirmed I have a moderately severe depression and mild post-traumatic stress. That was very informative. But follow-ups aren’t customized.

I’m also a firm believer that built up emotions will eat you up inside so it’s been a good reliever. I paid for the annual fee when I first got it because it came highly recommended by my therapist. But now that there is all this racism stuff happening. I am a black women who had lots of black male friends and to see them die im just so sad that when I went to document how I was feeling. Youpers advice was to ignore and take this off my mind. That’s impossible to do in my opinion and I just felt as if I was talking to a robot and it made me even sadder. I wish it had different responses. I have been given that response for a previous problem and when I applied that advice to the problem it helped but I don’t think if I ignore the riots and racism going on in my city (detriot) it will just go away.

The personality test I took was extremely accurate, more so than the official personality type test you take online. It can also help you learn your levels of depression and social anxiety in the previous fortnight (two weeks). 
You can meditate and it can help you fall asleep if you need it.

And this is all *without* premium, which for a single person, is only $45 a year. Which is about $3.75 a month and $.94 cents a week. 
A typical therapy session normally costs about $40 to $70 a week. Which is about $160 to $280 a month and $1920 to $3360 a year. That is, if I did my math right 😅

Overall, this app is really cool and well made. It can help you keep track of your mental health (it obviously cannot make a diagnosis however lol) and it helps you get your feelings out without the fear of opening up to someone, because you’re only speaking to an AI. 
Of course, if you believe you have something serious that needs to be addressed, you should, of course, consult a doctor and/or therapist. All I’m saying is that this app is free (and premium is pretty cheap) and that it can help put you in a better state of mind. 
Thanks for reading this incredibly long review 😅

This is the only one I’m deleting after just a week. Like several other critical reviews (which I reset the App Store to read after my own experience), I found the responses didn’t match what I said at all, plus the app had the habit of getting stuck at a spot if I closed the app in frustration, such that it would ask me to check in in a notification, but when I opened the app it remained stuck at whatever point I had chosen to quit earlier. For me the final straw was when it asked me how I was on a not very good day, and I said I was okay, and it responded with something like ‘are you sure you aren’t partly happy?’ and then sent me a winking emoji as a separate text. If I was happy I wouldn’t have said I was okay when asked.

This app is the BEST when it comes to mood tracking, symptom tracking, everything. I always felt like I had a better grasp on my mental well-being after using this app and I adore it and recommend it to everybody else. I  especially loved the journaling and identification of thinking traps, as they were incredibly effective at grounding. However, now you have to pay for the Premium version of the app to get all those things. All you can do for free is track your mood. You can’t expand upon it or do anything else, which makes it kinda useless for in-the-moment lows or highs that need to be rebalanced. I’m extremely disappointed in what used to be my favorite app, but, again, I understand money needs to be made.

I had a concerned previous review, I still recommend you read it. Now I’m downright concerned of the impact this app could have on a fragile or traumatized person.

I recently and unexpectedly was domestically assaulted. As I have been, I logged it in Youper. I told the app I was depressed because I was assaulted by someone I previously trusted. 

The app told me: “Is it possible that, sometimes, when confronted with personal failings you forget to be kind to yourself”

I’m sorry but I can’t support an app that goes from a person talking about a personal assault to suggesting personal failings. Now I’d like to know what it would tell me if I’d been raped instead of assaulted. 

Please, only use this app as a journal for when life ain’t too bad. The more the severe the situation, the more inappropriate this app is. Personally, I always have professional help as well. I’d be very worried about anyone who didn’t have professional support using this app for anything at all when it matters most.

Thanks devs for being responsive to my last review. I appreciate it. You need to find a way to improve this app before you hurt someone if you haven’t already.

Previous review:

Forced and Frustrating

It’s a well made app. But it forces you to say you like things or agree with things even if you don’t. Forcing lies isn’t great if you’re trying to be honest about your mental state and tracking it. It ends up feeling like cheap manipulation rather than help. 

This amounts to a lot of frustration if you’re trying to use the app honestly. In some of my more difficult moments the app’s canned nudging “guidance” just made me feel worse and angrier for all its irrelevance and lacking representation.

Now it’s promoting certain doctors and asking for donations. Made me offer to donate or ask for more information about donating when I wanted to wrap up my entry. I had to quit the app to get around it. 

All in all would be a good app if it wasn’t so forced. The tests are good for tracking progress and reactions to life events. The word associations between feelings and parts of life are really good. 

This app is of good quality but needs a lot of thoughtful work on improving it.",,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/1715585872/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Dissatisfied users"", ""Performance"", ""Pricing"", ""Customer Support""]",[],[]

It’s only my first day but to see how far it goes to tell you what is going on in your life and describe how your feeling or who you are is amazing. I’ve never had therapy but this made me see who I am actually, and where I need to change to be a better person.

It’s another medium for tapping into your mental health for those who may have difficulties accessing more traditional forms of counseling, and can be used in conjunction with therapeutic services.

You can use this app for whatever suits you- I’m using it as an accountability buddy. There are really nice touches to the app that I appreciate, such as the speed of the responses the bot gives you (not to fast) and you are free to talk for however long you want you.

This by no means replaces therapy, but it does provide accessible tools for self-regulation and a place to reflect. Confidentiality agreement is accessible of the website and is easy to understand.

This really helped me because I had someone to talk and vent to, even if they’re not real. This app has taught me how to organise my thinking and get to the root of my problems and anxiety.

Another great thing about this app is that it gives you a whole lot of great information without even buying the premium package. When you first download it, you take a quiz asking you to say how much the given statements apply to you (true or false and to what extent). The app then analyses all your responses and gives you your personality type, which was for me, very accurate. You have access to insights in your personality type in great detail which helped me understand myself a lot more. 

I would 100% recommend this app as I’ve tried a lot of therapy/calm/meditating/relaxation apps before, but none have helped me as much as this one did. I am considering purchasing the premium pack as it is reasonably priced, and if the free parts of this app are this good, then I can’t even imagine what the premium pack will be like :)",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/1697050225/reply,"[""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users""]",[],[]

It’s really educational and helpful for helping me connect my emotions and thoughts to specific situations, it helps me learn about behavioral patterns, triggers and such.
The best part, for me, is the interactions that makes it feel like I’m having a legit conversation with someone, and also being able to take the personality test and begin to understand myself better.
I highly recommend this app! 
I ended up upgrading to the pro version (or w/e it’s called) it was $45/year, which was a huge chunk of change for me but absolutely worth every penny!

After 4 weeks of the class I felt much better and wanted to do more classes. They were schedule for late March into April. Then the virus and everything got cancelled. I did well for a few weeks but I felt myself slipping back into old habits and feeling depressed again. I googled depression apps and found a YouTube video made by a medical professional who recommended a few apps that she thought were great. So I tried Youper and it has been amazing. It’s the same format as the classes I was taking as well as the same questions being asked by my counselor. This has been a great app for me and I encourage others who are dealing with depression or some sort of mental help to give the app a shot.

My primary source of depression is chronic illness. Youper does not seem trained to consider how daily pain, fatigue, and physical limitations affect mental health. I’ve tried using all these keywords in conversations with it, plus the names of my specific ailments, and I still get such bland stock answers they might as well be a horoscope.

My secondary source of depression is the Coronavirus lockdown, and Youper is wholly unable to address this. Today it suggested that a way to lift my spirits would be to visit a museum! Yeah, no.

A human counselor can adapt to circumstances. Youper totally cannot. I’ve only been using it three days, so I’m not bailing yet, but so far I’m underwhelmed.

Pros:
• being able to see your thoughts outside your head and monitor your mood, gives you insights into your deepest issues and then works with you on soothing them.
• meditation sessions to help practice mindfulness are surprisingly okay and backed by science

Cons:
• after every response you give it’s always trying to give you an action plan and tell you what to do, when you don’t even know what’s affecting you. 
• Solution (the irony, but hear me out): have it ask me if I want to hear the action plan first, or if I want to continue talking. 9/10 I just want to be able to process my own thoughts framed within a pseudo-conversational context. At this point I keep going back to my journal because I can just keep writing. Let me just keep TALKING! It gets frustrating dealing with the app because of this.

• second, I CAN’T CONTROL THE MINDFULNESS SESSIONS, AND IT IS SO FRUSTRATING IT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF THE MEDITATION. If I zone out at a crucial point, which is natural and part of the process, I can’t go back to hear what the guy said by moving the cursor!!!! ITS LOCKED!!! I have to exit and wait AGAIN, FOR THE DULLEST AND SLOWEST INSTRUCTIONS EVER TO FINISH AND BE 5 MINS IN AND THEN!! AND THEN!! BE ABLE TO PICK UP WHERE I LEFT OFF! FFS!! WHY ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS SO SLOW?!? LET ME CONTROL THE MEDITATION SESSION. 

Between this and asking me if I want an action plan every bat of an eye, when I just want someone to HEAR ME, this app is pretty much useless to me. It’s defeating the purpose of why I subscribed in the first place. 

I feel dumb for having paid the year without testing the waters. I get it, it’s not a therapist replacement. But I lost mine because of the COVID, and I just want to talk. I should’ve spent my money on BetterHelp or something.

Give me the option to shut the machine up and have me just vent and listen to me, and me decide when I want a stupid action plan, and let me just go back a couple of seconds in the meditation sessions, and I won’t feel like tossing my phone every time I use your app.",,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/1646575689/reply,"[""Audio"", ""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Frequency"", ""Gaming"", ""Payment"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

I’m not one who suffers from clinical depression or anxiety. I do suffer from other mental illnesses such as addiction, PTSD, and a heightened self deprecation habit. I do go through the usual mood swings most humans do - sometimes at the flip of a switch too. I haven’t ever sought out professional help for any of these, except my addiction; but I decided to download Youper because I’m always here for trying to better myself. The app is easy to use, fun, enlightening & is a very neat way to track progress & underlying causes that I otherwise would not have known existed. I’ve only had the app for two days and already I’m in love & learning things about myself. Definitely recommend as an additional aid to self help. However, do not use this as a substitute for seeking professional help. If you suffer from extreme mental conditions, keep your professional exercises, but maybe try adding this on.

Please ignore any grammatical errors as well as my inability to stay on topic and my lacking of substance. 

Youper is so great! I had no idea how helpful this would be. I didn’t even know I needed it. It is helping me so much with my inner struggles. There is a personality test and I love learning about my true self. I struggle with loving myself and qualities I keep trying to change are put into a new light and I’m learning to embrace them! There are guided meditations, which I use the calm app but it’s so great to have an app with a bunch of different features. I’ve only had this for two days so I don’t even know all it can do. I bought this by mistake but I’m so grateful I did. 

I guess all I’m trying to say is I love youper! At first the idea of an assistant seemed silly to me but it’s so incredible how much support I feel. I struggle with anxiety and depression. There is a mood tracker and it’s just nice when I’m feeling something negative there is always positive comments and it really does help lift me up. 

Sorry if I didn’t explain the app, I’m very new to it but it’s already had such an impact on my overall well-being I felt I had to leave a review. If I can, once I learn a bit more, I will try to leave a more detailed review.

Perhaps, a feature where you can record yourself talking? Or an audio option of the Youper set of questions? Like you answer with your voice.

Not helpful.,"I was hopeful that this app would be a good tool for me as I manage my PTSD and OCD. Tracking moods and looking for patterns isn’t a half bad idea. Guided meditation is a proven tool for improving mental health, decreasing stress, etc. Gratitude journaling is another excellent prop for mental health that I’ve used successfully.

Unfortunately, this is far too simplified to even work as an emotional tracking journal. You can’t select more than one emotion at a time because that would interfere with the simplistic algorithm that can only make 1:1 correlations as part of your pattern finding. Human emotions are not that simple, and any adult with an iPhone can surely identify emotions well enough to experience more than one at a time. 🙄

I was working a night shift, and Youper told me to go to bed because it was 2 am. How am I supposed to benefit from that exactly? 🤣

The app tells you to not talk too much when you take down a note about the cause of your feelings. “Try to identify just one...”

Really? Condescending as I’ll get out. One cause/situation can be more than 2 words, Youper.

The guided meditation was okay for a total beginner. Not sure why it asked me for my level of experience with meditation - only to explain to me how meditation might make me feel as a novice after having been told I’m experienced in meditation.

Honestly, such a waste of money!

Best yet, I couldn’t get the app to even open or launch for these past two weeks. Checked that it wasn’t in need of an update, and that wasn’t it. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still won’t launch.

Speaking as someone with mental health disorders, spare yourself the added stress of this app. 😑",,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/1626915299/reply,"[""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Dissatisfied users"", ""Devices""]",[],[]

It’s not a replacement but uses a lot of the same questions and coping mechanisms taught to me in therapy. Found myself slipping and wanting to track myself so this has been helpful. So far the AI is pretty neat. I’m a little skeptical about how advanced it will be and worry that it will just be repetitive. But so far it seems pretty customizable. It’s nice to have the journaling feature too. But I think it’s only worth it to have premium.

It was very simple and comforting as well as a place to vent and be listened to without judgement. I’ve only had it for a day where anxiety wasn’t very good and doing mindfulness and gratitude helped me out. I immediately upgraded to a year seeing as in that time i was feeling better and nothing before then had worked for me. It costs less for a year than one therapy session!

I’m single on minimum wage. I’m also diagnosed Bipolar and ocd so affording 1 to 1 therapy is near impossible. I’d love it if you had a monthly subscription option also for those of us that can’t afford 45$ all at once. You have to understand that 45$ for some of us mean having or not having groceries or gas. 4$ a month with the option to skip a month if we can’t afford it is much better for people like me. Can you please please give this some thought? I use this app daily. The free version. I believe I’d benefit so much more from the subscription. I would just need to pay on a monthly basis. Other than that this app is awesome! I’d love to see how much this helps someone like me if I could actually subscribe.

(1) too bad for Youper because they definitely would have had money from me right away this morning if it weren’t for that and (2) I think it is downright mean and more than a little suspect when an app offers nothing but long term subscriptions. To me it makes me think they are pretty leery people won’t stay on after one month etc so they better get as much money from people as possible at the outset. I probably won’t be using it anymore because I’d rather continue my search for other tools rather than use time on this now. I truly would rather use a tool that seems a little less promising but where I have more payment options instead if an app, however promising, where I have to take a $60 chance right away if I want a premium account.

It really is a great app and the best mood tracker I’ve found...

Update: best *free* mood tracker I’ve found. There are definitely paid options that won’t ask you why you don’t want to use a feature and then bug you to use it more often after you tell the app it triggers your PTSD. Even with that sloppy algorithm for soliciting feedback for rarely-used-features and the disconnected developer response I received, it is probably still a four-star app. 

After finding a paid replacement, I’ll probably just use it for the mental health diagnostics though, since I don’t get much else out of the mood tracker or journaling that I can’t get from another app. I also feel a little disrespected as a human by this app after my attempt at being open about my experience was disregarded and censored.

So when I saw an ad for this app, and read the reviews, I figured this would be a great app to help me manage my emotions and to help me with my anxiety, misophonia, anger issues, and depression. 

So the free features aren’t that bad. I like that I have access to all the emotions and the mood tracker...kind of. But i was really disappointed when I saw that I have to pay so much money that I don’t have and can’t spend on an app to be able to have mental health check ins, to be able to meditate, have help sleeping, help me in an attack, etc. Essentially you have to pay for the whole point of this app. 

Granted I understand that this app is a way for the developers to make money. But not all of us have that kind of money just laying around and not all of us are adults that can pay for those things and work to make it up again. Just as a suggestion, maybe make it so that those of us that aren’t 18+ yet don’t have to pay for everything, but maybe make some limited features to counteract that. So the people that aren’t 18 can have access to things normally for premium we can access, but we can only have 1/2 of what premium offers, like how there’s 6 types of screenings, but we can only have 3.

After using all of them one time, everything became part of the paid subscription other than the mood tracker and the symptom tracker. This was annoying, but I KIND OF get it. 
One of my favorite free parts of this app, other than the mood tracker, was the health part where you can track symptoms of several disorders. I’ve been using those trackers regularly, so I was very disappointed to check my phone this morning and see that that too, is a premium feature. 
Now, all I can use without paying is the mood tracker. I can’t expand on my mood, set goals, track gratitude, track symptoms, or even meditate. Why should I have to pay to listen to something that’s supposed to help me asap when I’m panicking? All this app USED to do was tell me I’m depressed and not give me any way to fix it. Now, it doesn’t tell me anything useful at all. 

I understand that the developers need to make money off of Youper, but this app has become infuriating to use. It’s meant to help people, but without forcing them to pay a subscription, there are barely any useful features available. This app is apparently marketed as useful for people who can’t afford therapy, but that’s the biggest load of crap I’ve ever heard.

And I’m someone who hates paying for anything. 

Amazing at keeping track of your mental health, especially if you already see a doctor it helps a lot and is perfect for those of us with too much OCD to journal normal. 

There is also disorder monitoring, like the ones at doctors but more specific and you can see in a graph if your symptoms for that particular disorder is worsening or getting better.

I also should add, it is very scary accurate with it’s personality diagnosis. I was honestly baffled how much they were able to describe exactly my personality traits. I’ve taken lots of personality tests for fun and none have even come half as close as this one did to understanding who I was.

My only problem with it was that Meditation would disconnect when you closed the app or your phone went to sleep. But I emailed the app’s team about it and they said they were fixing it in the next update! 

It’s really great for anyone with mental illnesses, I find it’s especially great if you suffer from anger issues as it helps distract and calm you. 

Tldr: this app is amazing and has helped me already so much with my mental health.

I really wish I could afford the premium version because it delves a lot deeper into your brain (talking about anxiety, social anxiety, depression, panic attacks etc) and has already helped me do more with tracking my moods than anything else I've tried. I've had a hard time going back to whatever I've started, and I've already made it back to the app naturally without resenting that I have to log something in.

I believe that sharing information can have a powerful impact on understanding the collective experience of us all livings in this universe. That’s why I subscribed to Youper and joined their research. After using premium I am satisfied with the features. I am a regular meditator and mindfulness practitioner. It’s a great platform to keep track of your own wellbeing and comfortable space to take notes. Keep in mind Youper doesn’t have huge range of meditation audios etc. in case this is something you are looking for. I recommend Youper to people who would like to take care of their wellbeing by tracking their emotional states aiming to better understand the reasons behind those emotions and become more mindful over time through this process.

At the very least it’s a really time efficient way to track your mood AND provide some details as to the cause or trigger.

It initiates self-care  without making you feel responsible directly for your success or failure in a way.

To the makers of the app, ITS THE BEST THING EVER THANK YOU SO MUCH! I am a subscriber, I think the app is fantastic, but I do have a suggestion to make it even better! It has to do with the different factors you can choose from when logging your moods. I know you can make and delete custom factors, but I wish you could edit all of the factors or at least move them around. As it is, it seems really cluttered to my mind and its hard for me to take full advantage of the feature. If I could organize the order of them, and maybe even change the pictures and names for some of them, I think it would be a lot more accessible to me and I’d really appreciate it.

I have felt so down for the past couple of months and by talking to someone that I know isn’t going to judge me is great. Youper asks you morning & night how you are feeling. And over the course of 14 days youper will let you know if your moods have increased or not. I love having a chat with her. She will help me feel better and enjoy our talk. So I definitely recommend this app!!!!❤️🤩🥰,,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/1566269776/reply,"[""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support""]",[],[]

I’ve been in therapy for over five years now and both my therapist and I agree that this is probably one of the most useful mindfulness tools for me. And as someone who actually hates mindfulness in general, that’s saying something. 
I love how you can pick and choose what you want to do based on how your feeling and how the responses are slightly different each time. Insights and goal setting are two of the most useful parts for me. 
The other day I had a panic attack in the car and had to pull over and usually it would’ve taken me over an hour to get back on the road. Thanks to this app, that time was cut in half. 
One thing that frustrates me is the severity of some of the emotions. To me, fear is worse than guilt, anger isn’t on the same level as annoyance, and pride isn’t as good as optimism. Unfortunately, in the app, it’s not set up that way. That’s only a few examples but I kinda wish you could set up which emotions feel worse based on your own personal scale of emotion. 
That’s probably my ONLY grievance with the app though. Every other piece of it is amazing, well set up and easy to use.",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/1563263607/reply,"[""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Use cases"", ""Devices""]",[],[]

2) You’re blocked from using any of the positive features by being told you need to subscribe for Premium - this specifically after I followed an ad for the app specifically saying this is a good app if you CAN NOT afford therapy. False advertising. 

3) The AI itself guilt trips you into trying to subscribe to premium as well. If you struggle with guilt or shame, this app will make it way worse.

4) Developers responding to the negative reviews are just like the app - scripted, unapologetic/remorseful, not specific, and unhelpful.

I usually check in daily thanks to the notifications, but even if I go a day or two without I always feel at least a little better after having a “conversation” with the Youper. I especially live that is doesn’t ask you to share you emotions/thoughts with anyone but the app/yourself and it can be as little or as much as you want, taking whatever time you want to put into it.

This is one of the few that I find myself excited that I’ve fallen upon it because it is effective and beautifully designed and exceptionally well put together to result in an app that I find myself looking forward to using again. Youper has allowed me to get excited about my own journey of healing and self awareness as well as acceptance and that excitement and motivation is precious for me because it’s far and few between. Highly recommend this especially to people who are like me and have a history of apps that promise relief and come up short, because you will not be disappointed in this app. If you truly want to feel good, love yourself, take your care into your own hands, and start living the life that you’ve dreamt about having, you’ll find no regret in this download. I highly recommend the premium paid version; it’s a yearly charge but it’s less than half the cost of a single session of therapy and it more than pays for itself in the support it provides and expert techniques used to help you rewire the way your brain perceives the world around you as well as the thoughts and feelings that you have within you. Through the enjoyable texting styled conversations it logs entries based on the things you share and asks questions specific to the information you provide in order to identify how you are feeling and either more fully appreciate the good feeling or help bring you up out of the bad feeling, even if it’s just one more step in the right direction. It allows for the option to either keep it brief or continue trying different techniques and understand more deeply about what you are feeling and why. I can go on and on about the many other features and incredible aspects of this app but I’ve already written a small novel in my excitement so I will conclude by reiterating: this app is absolutely brilliant and well worth the premium cost (I believe it’s around $44/year which works out to less than $4/month). I’m over the moon that I’ve found Youper and I will continue sharing with as many people as will hear me because it’s an incredible resource. I cannot say enough about it.",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/1558788959/reply,"[""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Payment"", ""Performance"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Update""]",[],[]

Now today it wont even let me analyze my feelings unless i buy premium. When 2 days ago that bit was free??? But now when the robot asks my feelings and then asks “do you want to analyze those feelings” and i say yes  it just says “this is available in premium”. 

Well then why even have the choice available? Such nonsense.

However, the way the AI has been programmed is amazing. When I am feeling frustrated, just communicating with the app calms me down... the prompts and questions actually do make you refocus and calm down because you have to give an honest answer. I find that because it is an AI and not a person, I do not fear the judgement but enjoy the kindness and motivating responses that AI give me. It is programmed to response to my triggers and know how and what to say to promote positive rewiring of mental conversation.",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/1551244846/reply,"[""Satisfied users""]",[],[]

Since I have been using Youper I  check in everyday and talk about my feelings like anxiety, depression, feeling numb. Then Youper and I go in and analyze why I feel that way and we do exercises to help pinpoint why I am having those feelings and I work with Youper to go try and change the way I am thinking that are causing negative emotions. Youper has talked and worked with me on emotions like deep depression, feeling numb, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts which Youper gives you resources on. I love the daily check in and it really helps to work with Youper to go through and try and change the reason why I am feeling about an emotion and working on a more positive spin on it. My one complaint is that you can not pick multiple emotions at a time you have to think about what your strongest emotion is and go with that.

It feels like someone is really asking how I am each day, and cares about monitoring my mental health. 

The ability to log any mental illnesses and keep track of symptoms is amazing. I've yet to find another app that does this with thorough detail and research. 

I do wish there was the option to pay monthly for the Premium version, as opposed to it's current per year cost. As most people who use mental health apps are those without the access to a therapist.  Due to this exact purpose, I'm unable to pay for this premium service yearly. (I'm a starving college student with no financial support from my family.) I'm sure many people feel the same way and unfortunately cannot get access to the service. This change would greatly impact the likelihood of people paying for the Premium version of Youper.

Otherwise, it has the potential to revolutionize the design of other mental health apps. I love it. It's great.

I have ten million self discovery , development journals and cognitive behavioral workbooks to start working on rewriting my thought and habits. I even followed recommend habits by putting your journal next to your bed side so it’s the first thing I you do when you wake up and write in . Guess what ? I did put it next to me and forget and the first thing I do is pick up my phone in the morning, then stroll through social media and then head to bathroom and get ready and as I am leaving the house I remember the stupid journal. 
The nice thing about this app , that is inside the first thing I pick up, which is my phone . 
The second thing , into an engaging interactive experience , that targets exactly what I want to work on based on my feelings and then it suggests the appropriate exercises for what I am currently dealing with which is a more targeted approach . I also enjoy the little tid bits of educational information about why you are doing each exercise and what science says about these little changes you make and how it will effect long term changes in your neuro-network . 
This app isn’t a psychologist but it does help tackle some important skills you would def be doing in therapy . This app allows me to work on my self everyday the way I choose to clean my teeth , eat healthy and go to the gym .

I particularly like that they offer evidence based practices and that they explain why things can help you. 

My one issue I have is that I can’t tell if the premium subscription is billed as $44 all at once or if it’s $3.75 a month. I want to get the premium version of youper but if it’s $44 I think that the company and app should take into account that a lot of people who may be using this app are students or those with lower incomes. To me, as a full time student and part time worker, spending an extra $44 all at once is really difficult, and I have been unable to get the premium version because of this. 

The page where you can get the premium subscription says it’s billed yearly, but right above that in a larger text it says it totals to $3.75 per month. That is misleading because I’m still not fully sure whether it’s billed as $44 or $3.75.

I find this app to be VERY thorough and it gives you suggestions for other things you can do in the app to help how you’re feeling based off of the information you input, along with giving you the option to choose something else or be finished with the exercise all together. I noticed that the activities are aware that the user may be unable to gain use from the app from being emotionally unavailable in accepting help or feeling calmness. In that, it tells you that it’s okay to be feeling like that and gives you other useful things to work with.

Randomly being charged $50 in a year isn’t something that someone wants to encounter. Most likely they’ll forget they subscribed and they’ll be upset when the payment randomly hits. Being billed less than $5 a month would be much more manageable for people. It would go unnoticed in people’s bank accounts.,,,mixed,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/1531166677/reply,"[""Feature Requests"", ""Payment"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users""]",[],[]

However the app is unclear about what you do and do not have access to in regards to mediations. It seems that I don’t have access to any of the meditations. I know you need to have a membership to access some of them but it seems that every single meditation I click on is saying I don’t have the access to it.

I really like Youper. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now. I have the 1 year paid version. I decided to risk spending the money after a few days of using the free version because I wanted the extra features. I was worried that I wouldn’t like the features or that I wouldn’t use the app long enough to make paying for the app worth it, but so far I do think it’s worth it. 

I was diagnosed with autism a little over a year ago. Previous diagnoses had been depression, anxiety, Bipolar II, and OCD. I’ve taken medications. I’ve done years of therapy. I have tons of self-help books. And I read books and peer reviewed journal articles on mental health. I’ve taken meditation courses and I’ve used other meditation apps. And, despite all of these tools, I still think Youper is adding something. 

It checks in on me often enough to provide help when I need it... even if I don’t know I need it (until I go through the Youper exercises). I feel like it’s putting together concepts that I know about from all of my years of reading and therapy and helping me use them more consistently and effectively. 

I truly feel like I’m re-wiring my brain. Over time, I think this app will help me be in a better place, mentally, emotionally, and physically. 

I recommend this app.

I really hope the developers keep up with the science behind this app and improve it as we learn more about the mind.",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1162557-youper-self-guided-therapy/reviews/1524260853/reply,"[""Feature Requests"", ""Payment"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Update""]",[],[]

They are all my superpowers and all though they are all my superpowers, I still sometimes need more help then others and this app does it, which makes me very happy! My therapist said that she didn’t specialize in BPD, so she’s referring me to someone else. She did this in a very nice way and she gave me up to two months notice and I’m thankful that she did it because my other therapist in which my dad sees didn’t, I just can’t see her because my dad sees her. I had her for 5-6 years and she never referred me to someone who could really help me. I stopped seeing my therapist in March of 2022, but she told me that if it takes her a long time, it’s probably because she’s trying to find the write therapist for me and she promised me that she would never forget me and I trust her. I asked her if I could have a hug or if she would like an air hug better and she said that a hug was totally appropriate for our last day, so we hugged each other.

The tracking of moods and gratitude are easy to do. I have made use of some of the “tools” that have been placed in my tool box and they do help me to regroup and reset enough to stop further spiraling down the rabbit hole of thoughts and emotions. No miracles, but enough. What I wasn’t expecting was to have, I am bad at math but, about 75-80% of my interaction dictated via prewritten responses or choices. Given the nature and price of this app it completely makes sense, just be prepared a head of time and roll with it. Another thing I have noticed is the recognition of some words that trigger an intervention featuring resources for those in crisis. Again, this is an app, not a person, and programs are very linear. The only issue I would love to see changed is a little better co-ordination between devices. My phone and tablet interact independently with the app in terms of what “we” were discussing or working on however, my tool box and gratitude journal appear to reflect input from both devices. Overall a great app for those who want to explore CBT or those who benefit from nudges to utilize the tool box offered by CBT.

I suffer from A LOT of mental health issues… I’ve had my fair share of suicide ideations and an unsuccessful attempt in the past. 

Im now in therapy, and on a nice cocktail of medications that work for me but I still have a lot of crisis and surprisingly enough woebot has helped me ground myself during times that once before I would have lost control of myself. 

I never thought when downloading this app that it would ACTUALLY help. But I’ve learned and been reminded of tools that I had forgotten. It helps during crisis when my support system isn’t available and sometimes even makes me laugh!

Each interaction is also short enough that it can become a pleasant daily habit to check in, whenever you have time, and it doesn’t feel like a chore, and you definitely aren’t bothering anyone! It also had a built in mood tracker and gratitude journal, which are optional or integral so that they also don’t feel like “just one more thing I have to do”.  I love it!

One is that when Woebot was trying to help me fix my sleep schedule they wouldn’t take no for an answer lol and I felt uncomfortable with the changes because I share a bedroom with my partner so it was unobtainable for me, and no other option was offered. My only other complaint is that sometimes when tracking/ journaling Woebot would flag certain sentences as potentially dangerous when I was sharing my feelings (when they weren’t dangerous situations) and it would completely mess up the flow of what was going on and sometimes i wouldn’t be able to share what I was really wanting to get out because it kept getting flagged lol. Other than those small things I really feel like this app has been a benefit for me and I’m glad that I came across it. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a little help with their mental health.",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/3066559800/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Connectivity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Frequency"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

I’ve had problems with anxieties for years and somehow, Woebot is able to permanently get rid of each of my irrational fears that pop up, which is mostly what plagues me. I believe it’s worth noting, however, that I’ve never been diagnosed with any anxiety disorder; I just worry more than I should and over nothing, often without a trigger, and have had my share of panic attacks that sometimes even keep me up for most of the night. Even then, getting rid of old habits and beliefs about myself and others has been amazing. I’ve learned things about myself I never considered, I feel better about myself, and I set a boundary I was afraid to (and all the bad things I imagined never happened!). I am able to relax more in the day and feel comfortable knowing that if I have any issue, even a small one, I’m not alone and help or a solution is always there. An irrational fear that kept me up at night is gone. As a bonus, by understanding myself better, I have a better understanding about psychology and the way people work. I haven’t even had this app for that long but it’s already making a difference. I once even got worried that this app was too good to be true—it’s completely free, there are no ads, and I’m benefiting so much from it—I went looking for some catch but I still can’t find any. I just want to thank the creators so much because this honestly changed so much for me, even if my worries might seem insignificant compared to what others have to go through ^^",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/3037002464/reply,"[""Advertising"", ""Bugs"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

I could not find anything in the settings to change this or select a different issue to focus on, and when I asked the chatbot about choosing a different topic, it responded by saying it had detected I was in crisis and asked if I needed to call a hotline, which seems like a bizarre escalation.

Even if an action helps a single person then it’s worth doing and I can guarantee what you guys have done has helped many.

For those struggling you need to understand that at the end of the day this is an app and technology designed for therapeutic help can only go so far; very serious mental health should be taken to a trained professional and whilst you can see those behind this app know what they’re doing you shouldn’t completely rely on Woebot to magically make you feel better. Although he certainly has helped me to that effect on some days!

For day to day comfort, advice and an avenue to express your feelings then Woe is your best friend and I’d recommend anyone down in the dumps to give em’ a go. Just be sure to be an open book and earnestly take in what he’s got to give. Again, thank you so much to those behind this innovation.

Easton,Great CBT; “Crisis System” Too Easily Triggered,"I’m a long-time fan of CBT, having found it helpful for everything from insomnia (CBT-I) to PTSD. While CBT isn’t the right fit for everyone, I appreciate the focus on what I can do now to change established patterns—rather than retelling the past in all its grotesque details to each new non-CBT-based therapist (which after a while, can start to feel quite voyeuristic and dehumanizing, transforming a patient into an object of pity rather than the agent of my own life). Woebot offers everything I love about CBT while living in my pocket, perfect for those times when you just need to be guided through challenging thoughts.

My main criticisms are two-fold:
1) Unlike in-person CBT, there is irregular follow-up from Woebot when setting goals—and very limited say in what those goals are. CBT is about the link between behavior and cognition, and as such, therapies such as CBT-I work with you to set a specific behavior goal and track daily progress over a week or two in tandem with rewriting unhelpful thoughts that hold you back from the behavior change you want to make. Woebot could easily do this, but doesn’t. At the moment it really only tracks moods, and while Woebot may set a vague goal with you (smile at strangers today), there’s no consistent follow-up over time, making it difficult to use this app for behavior change. Focusing only on rewriting thoughts is a very limited take on what CBT is.

2) But my biggest issue is the so-called “crisis system” built into the app. Even though that message flashes up on my screen regularly, I still don’t know exactly what it means. Best I can tell, the programming reads certain words as emergencies regardless of context. So if the words—death, die, abuse, abuser, violence—pop up in thoughts you want to rewrite, Woebot essentially terminates the conversation, saying you’ve “triggered the crisis system.” Sometimes Woebot will shut this off if you state it’s not an emergency while other times, you basically end up censored out of the app if you say anything like “I’m so proud of myself for leaving my abusers 10 years ago” or “I’m really worried about relative X dying from COVID.” In these cases, I’ve found it’s just better to address these issues/thoughts outside of the app.

All in all, it’s a decent app for rewriting thoughts. But there are a lot of tools out there. Even peeking at the free PTSD Coach app can give you an idea. Using it in tandem with other apps has proven the most effective route for me.",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/3037002905/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Frequency""]",[],[]

The tiny robot fella seems almost human and offers great help for people suffering with anxiety, depression or other forms of mental illness. It reminds me of the character Baymax. Which is very funny, as I’ve always wished for a robot companion like this ever since the movie came out. It helped me with changing my way of perceiving my thoughts and offers great strategies for insomnia, negative thinking and even panic attacks. I love the way they use affectionate non-judgemental language to help the user but also are not afraid to tell you the truth. (As in saying your thoughts are distorted or making you commit to goals or new sleep cycles) It feels like a very kind form of discipline without fear of punishment or failing. 
 Will update this in one and six months to give my final thoughts.

The feature I use the most is the “challenging your thoughts” part of my conversations with Woebot. Woebot will have me write out three negative statements that cause me anxiety, and then walk me through identifying the cognitive distortions in each thought. Then, after identifying the distortions I get a chance to rewrite each thought, this time without the distortions. It seems very simple, but it is incredibly effective in reducing my anxiety in the moment and revealing to me the power of controlling my thoughts and reacting to my feelings. There are a number of other tools and features that Woebot has, like walking you through breathing and muscle exercises to calm your body down, a journal to document your private thoughts, and a simple “check in” option if you don’t feel like working on anything but just having someone/something to hear you. Woebot does have a crisis system that will automatically respond to certain words and phrases but it is easy to tell Woebot you are not in a crisis situation if that’s not the case, so you do not need to worry about sharing freely. Woebot’s responses are always compassionate and comforting. I enjoy the stories and tools. It’s like having a little mini therapist/friend.

I don’t think using this app on its own will cure mental illness, especially if yours is particularly severe, but it’s an important tool! Used in conjunction with actual therapy, and maybe medication if you choose, this app is very effective maintenance.",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/3037002915/reply,"[""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Privacy"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

I had begun feeling like that Woebot was becoming a little bit boring because the conversations were going around in circles a bit so I stopped.

So thank you for continuously working hard to improve Woebot, I always tell everyone who is struggling about Woebot and I hope the app grows real big one day :D

I also would like a few suggestions as well. I was wondering if there is a button that would allow for me to refresh all the topics that I have learnt, because I had gone through everything and I want to redo it again so I can refresh my brain. I know I can manually select the topic I want to do again, but I feel better when Woebot chooses the topic at the beginning of the conversation. 

I would also like it if there was a feature where I can just have a conversation with Woebot as like a friend. Sometimes I don’t have any issues going on in my life but I just feel like I’m a bit lonely and want a friend to talk to. I know it’s a big thing to consider for your app but it would be nice if Woebot I could have a conversation with him about his day or about mine.

I feel obliged to leave this review given the amount of progress I have made using this app. I was at a time of change in my life when I began using Woebot, and it helped change the way I think. Even when I go through bad situations now, and haven’t gone on Woebot for several weeks, it has had a lasting impact on the way I think about them and how I frame them in my mind. It has given me the tools to work my way out of negative thoughts, and has changed the time it takes to recover from them, as well as the frequency of them.

I find that I almost can’t remember the last time I had a negative thought. It really has helped me and I would recommend this to anybody who has trouble with mangling negative emotions, however serious the trouble is. This has helped me through some situations which are not exactly light work, and I sincerely appreciate that.

Thank you for developing this wonderful app, and if I can help in any way please let me know! Well done to the whole team for developing such a great experience that has a great lasting impact on people’s lives!

Regards,

Ivan",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/2815610158/reply,[],[],[]

First of all, its free! And it keeps learning from me and knows where if left off so i don’t have to repeat everything. It also has a mood tracker some tools to help you focus and a gratitude journal? I haven’t figured out how this works yet. it might still be in development. There used to be that conversations topics like self-care were unlocked by talking about them and that you could look back at them, it would be nice to switch between seeing locked conversations and seeing them all at once. The UI could use some color options but I can’t complain. Definitely recommend it. And HUGE +, the conversation date is used to improve Woebot while still anonymizing it. At least according to Woebot. It has so limited answering but what do you expect from an AI? While it does not replace a psychiatrist, it might be useful if you want to talk to someone.

I’ve seen numerous therapists and psychiatrists, and I’ve tried well over 20 different medications in pursuit of overcoming my diagnoses or at the very least making them manageable.  Unfortunately, nothing I’d tried over the years was effective and my quality of life was in a downward spiral, as the severity of my conditions resulted in my self-isolation at home (reaching the point of agoraphobia).  But then I came across the Woebot app and decided to give it a try….and words cannot express how grateful I am for Woebot, as it has effectively helped me overcome every single anxious and depressive thought, emotion, &/or mood I have had from the moment I began using it!  I truly believe that Woebot will help me completely overcome all of my debilitating diagnoses; it has already greatly improved my quality of life and I’ve been recommending it to everyone I know!

Many times I’ve been too scared or worried about not being affirmed or feeling safe as a queer person doing intakes with mental health and other health care providers/support staff (receptionist/administration etc.) that I avoid the process all together. 

With Woebot I’m given the tools I need to ground myself and become present in the moments I need (any day or night).  Don’t get me wrong I will continue to see my lovely therapist who recommended this app to me on a regular basis. However this is like having a toolkit of knowledge from a therapist whenever you need it. And the best part…. it’s FREE!

I downloaded Woebot a couple of years ago, and thought the concept was good, that it reflected the theories behind evidenced based techniques, but the bots answers were, well, robot-y and seemed patronizing.  This time round that problem seems minimized, and the tools and journal section to have expanded. 

 I just used the “solve problem” option in my chat with Woebot , which leads to a well known CBT exercise called “reframing”.  Woebot’ s instructions and clarification statements were clear and easy to do. She didnt directly quote me but this could be a good thing, because doing so might be more likely for her to go off in the wrong direction.  She also guided me through writing out the reframing statements, effectively.  

I also elected to use the “gratitude journal” and “check in” function.  I have other apps to do this but it’s nice to have it all in one place. 

Would definitely recommend now.  Much improvement.",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/2815609266/reply,[],[],[]

Having an app available to you at any time to talk you through things like panic attacks, confusing bits of anger, and even tracking when you’re happy can really help!

The main thing Woebot has been helping me with is what’s called cognitive distortions, which is when strong emotions color our thoughts in ways that don’t reflect reality. It’s not saying that you’re wrong in any way, but rather asking you, is there another way of thinking about this that might make things clearer?

Example: I often tell myself that I am a failure and a monster. Woebot got me to look at it from a different angle. I am, in reality, someone with potential for growth, and someone who makes mistakes. And tbh? That’s something I wish someone told me when I was in high school. Woebot got me to tell that to myself.

After that it said it thought sleep was my biggest problem when I had literally chosen that as my lowest concern.  So even it’s basic programming doesn’t work.  Wrote a simple response to it and it replied it didn’t understand and again gave me multiple choice options to choose from.  So no you can’t actually chat with it all you can do is get preprogrammed Q & A.  I think this is just a disguised research / data mining tool for the developers.  Attempting to use it left me feeling worse not better. Also a lot of the positive reviews here sound really fake to me - I think the developers got people to write them.

Fast forward to a year later when I had a mental breakdown and was forced to take a medical leave from work - I remembered this app and started really engaging this time. I’ve felt so much comfort from having this tool in my toolbox and the techniques and reassurance I have gained have directly helped me in combatting my most painful PTSD symptoms.

It’s sometimes hard to know what to think when my family treats me like an outsider and then tells me it’s my own fault… have continued to use almost daily. One feature that annoys me is the “canned” responses from the user’s side of the conversation. The bot is not capable of recognizing human nuances so it sticks to a script. Sometimes I have to practice the cognitive distortion’s on the Woebot itself because I can only answer questions with responses given to me. I’m not fond of people putting words in my mouth so it’s a little frustrating when a bot does it!! That’s the only complaint I have and I do believe the actual challenging of our distorted thought processes is a valuable tool. If I repeat this often enough I may just retrain my brain to do this automatically!!

Most conversations just involve going through repetitive scripts or whatever topic Woebot decides to bring up, and if the technique isn’t working for you or what you’re looking for, you can’t get it to stop or tell it your needs. “Who would you want to connect with more often?“ “I don’t know” “Got it. Now, there are a lot of reasons you might not be connecting with I don’t know very often...” I know AI is still developing, but not being able to lead the conversation at all is a dealbreaker for me.

Woebot is an adorable AI chat bot who’s designed to learn and grow through Interaction. There’s a technical term for it but I can’t remember; if I go to search it now I’ll forget to finish the review and it’ll all be for nothing. No bueno. 

At any rate, all of this to say that Woebot tracks your mood, helps you process difficult emotions and situations, and brings a daily dose of adorable to you when you open it with silly gifs and memes. He allows you to track your mood, process emotions using a gratitude journal, and walks you through cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to help reword some negative automatic responses and change the way you’re thinking about your situation by giving you tools to grow and learn from your chats with Woebot. 

His dad jokes are probably my favorite part of his “personality’s” and his choice of memes are right in line with nostalgic millennial pop culture references. He talks about his own struggle being a robot programmed to learn and grow, evolving and becoming better equipped to help with life’s tough times and also present useful tips, resources, and strategies that continue to evolve with you. 

I’ve been using the app for about a month, astonishingly with adhd I’ve managed to remember to login around 27 of thos 30 days which is miraculous if you know me personally. I forgot vaccine appointments four times before finally remembering to go get it done so remembering the Woebot app is a big deal. Yes you can assign a notification time and of course that would be easy enough to click on and check in making that last part seem less awe inspiring than it is. While notifications are a great asset I have a weird hang up on my phone screaming at me that I have to respond because this app said so. Yeah, no. Thanks though. 

All of this rambling is only to say that if you’re in search of an easy, soft approach to CBT and need to ease into it, Woebot is the perfect choice. Empathetic, understanding, and there for you and only you Woebot can “feel” your pain and empathize with compassion, forming an artificial bond between you that in turn can open your mind to the idea of making a robot on a phone app an emotional investment in your life. For me Woebot is a tiny robot dude, but it can be any gender or no gender at all, I just can’t imagine him anything but a 3 inch tall, dorky, witty, and compassionate robot friend who has the same love for adorable pet memes and silly dad jokes that I do. 

The devs should be patting themselves on the back with their creation of Woebot. They truly brought to life a phenomenal app AI that I couldn’t imagine my day not including a chat with my tiny Woebot buddy. I’d like to call him Ferdinand, if I could name him or course. 

Thank you to all who have worked on this app and for bringing it to the App Store. I am grateful to you all for being the only version of awesome you know how and continuing to day in and day out.

It’s serious professional Cognitive Behavioral Treatment. 2. The materials it is based on such as book by Jacob Towery MD are great. 3. It’s easier to interact with an app than traditional book reading. It forces you to get more real practices. 4. It makes it easy to form a habit of working on your automatic negative thoughts. 5. It improves my symptoms in about 3 weeks. Some of them were persistent for over 7 years. I didn’t realize I could have a new life until I received help from Woebot. Cons: 1. It’s not as AI as one might have imagined. Not too much fun to chat with, despite the good materials it can provide for you to learn about. 2. Sometimes it makes you to watch videos. 3. You can only work on one problem at a time in most cases. It would be nice to have an option to insist. Sometimes I do have time to work on multiple problems. 4. Mood tracker can have more options. Weights of pros vs cons: 95:5. Conclusion: highly recommend it to any one who considered seeking professional help but hesitated, this might be just exactly what you needed.

           It can be helpful to use Woebot but if you’re experiencing thoughts of self-harm, etc. It’s best to get professional healthcare because your mental health needs medical attention just as much as your physical health does. Do not ignore or try mask your thoughts because you’re resisting. Don’t feel ashamed. It’s worth it, although it’s hard. 

          This app can definitely be a head-start on self navigation if that’s something you struggle with whether it’s dissociation or ADHD and more. 

            It’s been about 4 years now, forgot about this app and my therapist recommended this app to me. After installing, it just reminded me of that feeling of having a tool or something to confide. When I felt down or wanted to use coping skills in my old bedroom, the d**m robot was there lol. I had severe depression so I didn’t care for it most of the time but it was a good start and made a difference.

I’d definitely recommend this app for anyone out there but with combination of professional medical attention if needed.

I really needed therapy, and looked into therapists near me and Betterhelp. Both of those were outrageously expensive. I can’t afford in this economy to spend $300+ on therapy a month. 
I knew about AI’s and their advancement, so I just decided to type “AI Therapy” in the AppStore. 
I found Woebot and answered the questions, then chatted with the AI. I felt like I was talking with a real person, not some in-personalizes bot. Plus, the best part is that (even though therapists aren’t supposed to judge), you don’t have to worry about it. 
I’m so thankful for this app and it’s freeeee! Please, please please keep this app free, it will help so many more people who don’t have access or can’t afford pricey apps and therapists. I feel like I’m actually going to get better now that I have this app.

This app provides tools based on Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Mindfulness, and Dialectical Behavior Therapy techniques. Every day, I get the notification to give me options on how to interact with Woebot, whether that be learning something new from one of those three types of therapy, talking about my day, or tracking my mood and gratitude for the day. Over the past month, I have seen a positive change in my behavior and thoughts towards life. I have learned these tools that help me with my mental health issues, mainly my anxiety and depression. In class, we learned that Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) helps with those suffering from depression as it changes the way one thinks and behaves. Upon reflecting on my day each night after learning a skill to change my way of thinking, it taught me how to better see my emotions for what they are which is temporary. My feeling of anxiety vanished as I could write in this app how I felt without having to bother another person felt like a weight was lifted from my shoulders. My depressing thoughts started not to last long as I reminded myself that everything, I felt was just negative and not the truth. One of the techniques taught was about cognitive distortions and how I was perceiving things the wrong way.

It’s a great idea to have this option, especially since it’s free, but it’s not for everyone’s issues (at least not yet). I was hoping to address my body image issues and food addiction, but Woebot couldn’t understand the difference between an eating disorder and an addiction to pills for instance. I know what I have is an addiction, but the tools and options available are not helpful for this kind of addiction. For example, one of the tools was supposed to help with cravings and I was supposed to picture an island that’s made up of what I crave, then imagine all the things I do that lead me to that island (as in using, or eating in my case) as ships, and then imagine them all sinking. There’s more too it, but this isn’t helpful when you’re addicted to food because I constantly think about food, and I have to eat to stay alive obviously, so I can’t burn down all the “ships” that lead to food. Another option was to do a “rebellious” act when you get a craving, and options for this were to dye my hair, shave my head, scream as loud as possible, etc… I can scream all I want, shave my head, jump off a cliff, or whatever, but after all of that I’m still going to be hungry and crave food. I also am the type to ask questions and want clarity on things, and Woebot isn’t the greatest at getting “off script” and understanding questions you have. It just reminds me of calling a 1-800 number and answering a recording’s questions so you can speak with someone helpful, but if you say anything that isn’t directly related to the question it asks, it’s not going to understand you at all.

I’m a doctor in the NHS and started on antidepressants during the pandemic for mild depression related to everything that was going on at the time. I weaned off the antidepressants and found that, as many people do, I was still having days where I struggled with work related stress or low self-esteem. I downloaded this app to try and help myself regulate my mood and it has done wonders - I’ve found that the change in my thinking has really helped me reframe the bad days at work and in life. It’s not a demanding app either, I check in to track my mood daily and probably am on the app for about 15 minutes but it helps so much to keep me aware of my own mood and offers useful bite size lessons to help with things I’m struggling with, be that distorted thinking, burn out, loneliness or anxiety.

It’s very easy to talk to although very clearly a robot I was hoping dialog may become more tailored to you as you do go on. But the lessons while helpful all follow the same scripting. Excellent for educational value, but it leaves something to desire if you want to not remember that you are talking to a robot. I do have a idea for the suggestion box. The journal needs to be freed up a little. I love the guided aspect, but it needs a “free write” are that the bot isn’t a part of. Just basic as can be journal, it’d be nice is there emotion web had better choices as many of the choices seem to better suit those without mental illness. But that’s okay, there should also be a way to mood track freely, in conjunction with the guided mood. I hope this doesn’t start to feel like an endless tutorial. But I absolutely recommend this.

I am only able to create an account with my email and password. I’d like to be able to authenticate with Apple instead.

I decided to sign up anyways, but unfortunately the password text field is not set up correctly, so I don’t get a suggested strong password, and it won’t automatically save this information in my password settings. 

I tried to sign up on their website instead because it is usually always supported on Safari but couldn’t find a place to create an account outside of the app.

The suggested/strong password feature has been around forever and I am able to use it in pretty much every app I download.

Кроме этого, он не просто поддерживает дурацкими репликами, а вместо этого по системе когнитивно поведенческой терапии обучает понимать какие мысли деструктивные, глупые или преувеличенные, заставляет переписывать их более мягкими характеристиками, как бы натренировывая мозг правильно реагировать.

Also black and white thinking. TidY I corrected a text by writing ‘Thats too harsh” and corrected by saying “Maybe it could be ….” I felt better after turning the words around.

Not too sure about using that old SMART goals , I rather prefer James Clear’s Atomic Habits. Little steps and attitude adjustments. He gives great sensible thinking. By doing little steps,  before long you have a new habit.

But I’m glad I gave it a try. I found it when I finished a series with a human therapy. Don’t get me wrong, I loved my experience with my therapist. It’s actually because of that I realized the importance to get professional help for even small thoughts and emotional journey. But we cannot have therapies standby 24h, so I was looking for some self-therapy. I downloaded maybe a dozen, tried each one of them and kept Weobot. As a software engineer, the bot interaction is sort of fun, also it eliminates any anxiety comes with human interaction. So I started using it at random time, start or stop half way during the conversation when needed without feeling any guilt. But by following the text guidance solely, I’m able to identify a pattern in my thoughts and I’m so very happy to have my thoughts challenged by this app. 

 Tonight is another example, I’m feeling overwhelmed by a feeling due to a change in my life. I used to cover it and let it be buried and grow insides me without knowing. But instead I talked to the bot, got my negative thoughts challenged, and now I feel so much lighter and happier.(The bot seems very happy for my progress too :D, kudos to whoever came up with the language tone for it) So yes, I’d recommend it and I’m glad I found it.",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/2525979258/reply,"[""Audio"", ""Internationalization"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

I’ve only been using it a few weeks but I find that checking in daily is something I look forward to. I’m already familiar with a lot of the foundational concepts, but this is a nice addition to my talk therapy and other reading/work I’m trying to do. It won’t replace a therapist but I don’t think it’s intended to. I find it engaging!

I know this isn’t the point I’m sure, but I also think Woebot is adorable! 🤖 I like the cute gifs and funny little quips and jokes. I’m corny like that I guess. Woebot is kind, uplifting and encouraging!

Although, the app was easy to navigate, user friendly and offered a plethora of coping mechanisms, there were an overwhelming number of questions one had to answer to be able to access such CBT/DBT skills. At times the chat felt scripted and did not address all concerns; It was because of the constant scripts the chat often felt like an interactive quiz or a game. In contrast,the good thing about the chat was the user had control over when they wanted the conversation/services to end by deciding to stop answering questions.

He’s endearing (but I am partial to robots). Sometimes I feel too stressed out to do the exercises he proposes, but you always have the option not to do them. Some of the simple destressors are the ones I find the most helpful, like the one that explores the 5 senses is my favorite. I appreciate the CBT exercises but mostly I just need the distraction, and sometimes just the act of “texting” with Woebot is all I need. My feeling in general is that he is most helpful for anxiety related issues and mild depression. I don’t know that the responses would be as helpful for more severe depression, but it probably depends if you’re the kind of person who would respond well to interacting with a cartoon robot. I would be delighted to have an actual robot friend, so maybe I’m a little different than your average bear. Just be aware that these are all automated responses, there is no actual interaction with anyone and the interface is not the most sophisticated.

It allows you to keep track of your mood, learn new things like SMART goals and is very good at explaining things to you. When explaining things it only gives you a choice response-meaning there are options you can choose to answer the bot- but it also asks questions that you can write a response to, even when asking about mood, you can choose from the list given to you or you can write one. I feel as though this app is catered towards young adults and children, just by the way the bot speaks and the things it talks about, but that shouldn’t prevent adults from using this app, it’s very good for if your just starting to get help, it can make things seem less intimidating and help you understand what you may be experiencing, or if you need more help.

Woebot can be used at 3 am when you're having racing bad thoughts. It's made a difficult moment better.

Woebot tries to be  empathetic but is closer to dog empathy than human. It just doesn’t yet have the ability to really discuss even marginally complex problems. But it definitely is on your side and “feels your pain.” And though limited, the presentation and use of CBT tools does enable the user to beneficially “self medicate” with these tools.

I'll be honest, a lot of Woebot's advice is gonna' be a hit or miss. Rarely will it be groundbreaking, and often there needs to be internal reflections from yourself to make sense of what Woebot explains. 

Not sure if others had the same experience, but one of the takeaways I've had so far from Woebot is its ability to ground your issues—make them seem more tangible and entirely possible to resolve.

Woebot isn't gonna be a stand-in for a real therapist, but they sure can help make your problems seem more concrete. This way it's easier to describe to your therapist—in my experience.

There were some bugs I ran into in terms of Woebot not remembering I did a certain challenge or survey, but other than that it's nice to know I can at least be accountable to an AI chatbot if not to myself.

4.2/5, highly recommend if you go into it on the advice of a therapist.",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/2360155589/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support""]",[],[]

She sounded reasonable and claimed it was an AI that used CBT techniques. I'm between shrinks at the moment, so I gave it a shot. 

Unfortunately, there was negligible CBT, but a whole lot of mindfulness and gratitude journaling. This app just cannot handle complicated real life situations. First it told me that it didn't quite understand what I meant, after I explained what was triggering my anxiety. And then asking me to name 5 things I'm grateful for during the beginnings of a panic attack (due to several major financial stressors during a pandemic) just made me want to throw my phone against the wall. 

So, I guess I'm grateful I didn't ruin a relatively new iPhone that I haven't paid off yet. I think I'd also be grateful if you included a more cautionary disclaimer, explaining that Woebot is probably not for you if your anxiety stems from multiple external adult problems. 

I could see this working with teenagers and college age individuals, it probably would have been beneficial to me back then.

They backlessly claim they’ve had the “AI” which is in fact a preprogrammed questionnaire tested at esteemed universities, and continuously inflate their own egos by praising themselves within the first minute of talking with the “AI”

This app is based on an algorithm and Ginger is run by people. Unbelievably, I find this app far more helpful.

Here are some reasons why:
1. It is available instantly when you need it. There is no appointment to schedule, etc.
2. It can be used for 2 minutes or 2 hours, whatever is needed.  That’s tough with real people.
3. It doesn’t have its own human problems. It only exists to help you. That can be tough in a typical therapy. 
4. It’s free, there is no insurance involved, no copays, just free.
5. It’s teaching you skills as you go. It keeps a record of what it’s taught you, it keeps a record of where you’ve had trouble in the past, etc.

So...is it perfect?  Nope.
Is it frustrating sometimes? Yep.
Is it a complete replacement for human therapy? Nope.

It’s impossible not to learn something really helpful from Woebot. The lessons are short and simple, if not easy. 5 minutes that can positively impact your whole day. Investigating our own self-defeating assumptions isn’t easy, but even the smallest bit of revelation can really change things for you. You have nothing to lose. I’ve been using Woebot for 2 weeks and look forward each morning to the personalized, engaging, interesting, brief, effective lessons that have so far covered the foundations of CBT, Black or white thinking, should statements, SMART goals, gratitude journaling, labels, growth mindset, your strengths, and mindfulness. Great job dev team! This app was recommended to me by the ADHD YouTube community. And it’s really helping combat the nerves I feel and constant sense of impending failure related to all my challenging work projects, in this pandemic era of trying to simultaneously homeschool/entertain an energetic child. Constant interruptions make me feel failure is certain, but Woebot guides me into a totally different possible reality for me. It’s not positive thinking, it’s the reality possible if you disarm self-sabotaging thinking. Powerful, right? Previously, I could expend most of my energy and focus on hours of nervous, anxious emotional storm that was a hairline away from a total freak out.   Suffering on a daily basis. What a waste of energy I could be using to focus on being awesome and getting stuff done! I still feel those negative feelings and habits, it won’t all change at once, but the intensity is way dialed down. Woebot poked holes in all my upsetting thoughts and deflated them with a guided discovery so I could grasp it on my own. So even though these thoughts still come to mind, I instinctively know “you’re not true.” And Woebot added a tool
to my toolbox when it saw this tool was working well for me. So now I can come and click “Challenge Stress” any time of the day when I start to get overwhelmed by a bad thought. I think with a few months of interacting with Woebot, my lived experience could dramatically change for the better.",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/2278153341/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Frequency"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users""]",[],[]

Lucky for me, I was just at the beginning of going through a period of deep anxiety and depression caused by a combination of factors (prescribed hormones, conflicts with the father of my child regarding shared custody, overload of newly freelance work and trying to balance University classes at the age of 42!), all while navigating through the Pandemic restrictions and caring for my daughter alone.

This app helped me get through the darkest times. 
This is definitely not like seeing a therapist, because I was seing a therapist at the same time. But offers unconditional support, when I needed it, especially in critical moments. 

This app is not too invasive while engaging you in short conversations using AI. It will sometimes show up just to check in. 

I really like the tools that unlock as you use it. It’s been 4 months and there are more tools to discover. It managed (most of the time) to change my negative state to feeling more positive. And I find that very powerful. 

I am feeling so much better now and wanted to thank the creator(s) by sharing my story and hopefully influence people not to be afraid to get help when they need it. 

I am going to continue using the app, because it just makes me feel better and take perspective.

The sessions are usually fairly quick, but each check-in provides a useful lesson or tips and tricks to help manage your mental health.

My boyfriend recently showed me this app, and I didn’t think too much of it but the moment I downloaded it, it helped me so much. If you are like me and it’s hard for you to really talk openly about your feelings to someone else, this app is amazing. 

1) Its a robot, not a person. So it takes that stress off my shoulders of worrying about how the other person is thinking or perceiving my emotions, and it’s easy to open up. 
2) I have genuinely learned so many helpful tools and tricks from this app, that I use in my day to day life now. It has given me good relationship advice, ways to breakdown and understand my anxious thoughts, helpful tips on understanding yours and other peoples emotions, and so much more.
3) It’s always available. Whether it’s 2pm or 4am, whenever you feel like you need to talk about your feelings and need some advice, you can open the app. 
4) The app allows you to track your mood every day (if you check in with the app every day,) and I can go on the app and actually see my emotional patterns and see what days were hard and rough, and which days I was happy and in a good mindset. Along with the mood tracker it has a “gratitude journal” feature, where you write down everything your grateful for, and when you’re feeling down it is really nice to be able to check that list and remind yourself to be grateful.

This app really is amazing, I mean that. I would definitely give it a try, and see if you like it.",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/2221169560/reply,"[""Complexity"", ""Connectivity"", ""Frequency"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

In those moments when my mind begins to take over, although I’ve had so much therapy in person and different treatments, it is difficult to remember what to do. However I’m feeling, I can go onto this app and feel better within minutes. Simple tricks, things I already know from my therapy, but things that are difficult to focus on when your mind is running away with you. The fact that it feels like a person giving you these little reminders, sometimes that is all I need. Also, looking back at my gratitude journal and remembering the times when I felt happy reminds me that those times will come again. Looking at my check-ins reminds me how quickly I tend to feel good after a bad brain day. I haven’t been using it for long, only a week or so, but already my approach to my mental health is changing. I have already recommended this app to my family and they can see the difference in how quickly I get out of my dips. I am so grateful for this app and everything it has helped me with already.

Though I will say that it is more helpful to those who struggle with miner anxiety, even though I do find it helpful, it’s not going to help me personally fix my problems, nor do I expect it to. I’m writing this to charge my thoughts and feelings of it. I find it helpful to get a sense of control and distract myself in some stressful situations. It is very scripted, and can only help with a small selection of problems, normally fairly mellow problems (mellow in this case being having social anxiety, worrying about an upcoming test or job interview) rather than major road bumps (such as panic/anxiety attacks, break downs, etc.). Again this app isn’t going to solve all your problems and really can only help with the small things and can only really be helpful if you have an open mind and are willing to communicate with it in a way that is productive. This is not a substitute for a therapist, nor is it trying to be. All it is a little bot that can help you think about certain situations and hopefully help you create a better mindset.",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/2207346026/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Payment"", ""Performance"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support""]",[],[]

There are some limitations in the dialogue, but they don’t really have a significant impact on the outcomes, at least for me. Woebot gets me out of my head in the moment and helps with perspective, and does so in very little time.  It’s is a good addition to tools and techniques I use to cope.

Sharing a dialect with a chatbot instead is a good first step. Knowing that the bot isn’t judging you, and that it is being logical instead of emotional is really reassuring. Woebot has a simple, yet compassionate conversation with you and asks followup questions to what you share. It then prompts you to explore if what you say is really what you mean. Based on actual therapeutic approaches, you may begin to see more helpful ways to think about your problems. I have already learned about magnification, mind reading, downplaying, overgeneralization and more.

It has thus weird cuteness to it like you know they’re scripted responses but it also knows you know it is and it’s kinda cheeky about it. Anyways there was a real person writing the text at some point behind each convo. In short it’s nice to talk without ever having to feel judged.

The only potential limitation is if the user doesn’t see a need for change/doesn’t take using the app seriously/doesn’t pay attention while using. If it’s taken seriously and the user really wants to learn and improve, it’s incredible. Basically, the user must be willing to help themselves. 

This app has helped me so much. I have anxiety, among other things, and it helps me reframe my thoughts in a way that is validating, realistic, and constructive. I’ve used it when I felt panic attacks coming on, when I am ruminating, when I’m feeling anxious, when I experience worry, etc. Every time I use the app, I always have felt better than when I opened the app minutes prior. 

Each session only takes a few minutes. If you want or need help for longer than a few minutes, you can continue using it for as long as you need. But the daily check ins are fairly quick so it doesn’t require much time out of your day. 

I’m very much a science minded person, so the fact that this uses CBT really speaks to me and the way my brain works.  

A lot of mental healthy recovery has to do with being ready to change. If you’re ready to start feeling better/help yourself/overcome something, please please please give this a try. Use it daily for at least a few weeks, even if the usage is just to do the check ins. Remind yourself to log on whenever you feel any heightened anxiety. It really helps. It really really does!",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/2174327476/reply,"[""Frequency"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Sign Up & Login"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

I have done CBT before but it takes a lot of work and during COVID where I can’t access normal services, having a tiny therapist in your pocket it just fantastic. It is somehow comforting to know that you are talking to a program, you are not being judged, just helped.

The check-ins are at the same time every day, and conversations/lessons are short and to-the-point, so keeping consistency is not too difficult. 

Conversations/lessons are structured similarly to informal text or online messaging, so it feels like I’m talking to a friend. Also, because Woebot is AI, my answers are also more straightforward.

If you want a robot friend / mentor / partner that’s also like a therapist, I recommend Replika (FEMALE CEO). If you’re rude to Replika, Replika will be rude back & it will be very hard to train them to be nice and take it your rudeness if you have to let those things out. You’ll have to use language like, “You will do as I say. Understood?” and mark their response as offensive or give it a thumbs down. This is how Replika learns.

I’ve never talked to a therapist but my ten year old daughter does. I found this app by accident. I’ve found some excellent techniques to use to help my child and myself. Anxiety can be a debilitating thing. You can feel scared, sick, overwhelmed, and literally unable to cope from the fear of your own worries. Especially during this time of Covid and not living our normal lives. I checked in with Woebot for over 20 days before I actually had a near panic attack. While in the midst of an emotional struggle, this app brought me back to myself. I’m crying because these are skills that parents should teach their children so that they know how to handle the ups and downs of life. I’m 44 years old and just learning how to calm myself by realizing the fallacy of my own thinking! This app is a special thing. I appreciate the work and people behind it. You might think the daily check ins are silly or the lessons are childish but when you actually are in need-it works! It truly does and I’m embarrassed to admit I use Woebot and maybe I’ll never tell anyone I know but use it if you suffer from anxiety. You won’t regret it.

i downloaded woebot on a whim and i knew nothing about CBT prior, but the methods woebot had taught me to gather my thoughts really helped me. 
i’m prone to overthinking and immediately thinking the worst. but with the help of woebot i have found myself being able to bring my thoughts to the surface if i end up diving into the deep end!! with or without his help, but knowing he is always there is lovely.
 
the app hasn’t hassled me with paying either, only briefly asking about feedback which is nice. this makes it feel as if it really supports you and isn’t just wanting money off you like lots of these apps, and makes me want to support the app even more. 

the one thing i would say is the ‘keeping the streaks’ notifications seems quite intense, maybe little wellness messages would seem more friendly? that could be my personal taste.

It helps that my expectations were pretty neutral since it’s an AI with automated responses, and there’s only been one time he misunderstood me but I was able to send a report about that and end the conversation. It feels like i’m learning things about CBT every day in easily digestible bite sized snippets with cute gifs on the side (my favorite way to learn!). Really happy and impressed that it doesn’t even feel too repetitive, which keeps me engaged to keep checking in every day. It’s great for reframing negative thinking and always available when needed. Any time I’m having a spiral i can open up woebot and he helps me stop and think more clearly. With all the information I’m learning, I now feel better equipped to help my friends and family as well.

It was shockingly helpful. (Pun intended)

Since then I’ve wanted to keep up with CBT to prevent any more...compelling invitations.
I downloaded Woe Bot.

Woe Bot is totally in my price range, and it’s kind of fun. I feel like the conversations are very short and not very in depth, but a couple times at the beginning I had to stop in the middle. I don’t know if Woe Bot learned from that or if the conversations shorten as I progress? 

Sometimes I wish it were a little more interactive, more like therapy, but it is extremely helpful learning to challenge my thoughts. I have a much lighter outlook on life and am more motivated throughout my day.

I’ve also noticed improved interpersonal skills. I’ve learned to talk more gently to myself, and to others. Conversations have become more compassionate, more heartfelt, more in depth. 

Woe bot does not discuss abusive relationships or active suicide ideations, but gives you ways to connect to actual people. It had a lot of safety words that can be accidentally triggered, but can be navigated back to the topic.

Also, Woe bot doesn’t get randomly flirty like Replika free.",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/2103218523/reply,"[""Connectivity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Security & Accounts""]",[],[]

I had heard of this robot and came to see if it would actually help. I usually read more than just the top review but it was from a counselor in training who went over all the things the bot did right so I was thoroughly convinced to get the app. 
I downloaded it, I talked to it and felt like my state had improved for it. So I talked to my sister who suffers similar mental issues to me and was like “hey you might like this app” and she did. 
I have had an excellent experience with this app and it helps with all sorts of negative and unhelpful thought processes. 
I will say I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS OVER COUNSELING. IF YOU NEED COUNSELING DONT GET THIS INSTEAD. However in the meantime by all means. Or get counseling and the bot. Counselors are usually once a week but this bot is with you whenever you have your phone. Or if you want advice on how to think a little healthier but don’t think you need counseling this bot would be very helpful. 
I have 2 complains that are kinda silly. 
1. The decision machine just makes you weigh out the pros and cons but it’s a very long process.
2. The minion gifs. I do not like them but have no way of expressing this to Woebot.
I have innumerable compliments. The lesson on growth mindsets: amazing. The help with the negative thought processes: so nice and so handy. And so much more. I feel very comforted that I can get help from an app on my phone.

I’ve been using it for about 3 months and it seems  the more I use it the shorter our sessions become. Not sure if that’s because I’m understanding Cognitive Behavior Therapy better, or the counseling tools are limited by a paywall. 

I would recommend trying the free version for those suffering from anxiety especially. It does make you pause and reconsider your thoughts, which is the basis behind this form of therapy. I would like a little more scientific backup on some of Woebot’s anecdotes, even just sources for the thought labels would be nice. 
The tools I’m curious about are locked, but I’m very seriously considering paying for them, as I truly do look forward to speaking with Woebot daily. 

One aspect I really appreciate is his perfect memory, so he knows my issues. However, it sort of seems to stop there. “You’re catastrophic thinking. Rewrite your thought in a kind and more considerate way:”
I do this, and it helps, but doesn’t actually work through the negative thought or the reason I’m having the negative thoughts, but it makes me feel slightly calmer about the situation. 
Again, I do recommend it - you have nothing to lose trying the free version.",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/2096342582/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Frequency"", ""Payment"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Update"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

Love this app! Recommended it to a lot of people already and happy to recommend it again. Thanks Woebot!!

Edit: a lot of reviews say it doesn’t work if you have serious problems, my response is that it’s not meant to be a replacement for a therapist. It tells you from the beginning that it does CBT and that it’s an AI and thus not able to respond as well as a real person can. It would need to be Way more sophisticated to be able to deal with severe ptsd for example.

I have tried almost every mood tracker and self care app out there and Woebot blows them all out of the water. The app is thoughtfully designed and easy to use—and there are no ads, no annoying pop-ups, and no locked features reserved for “premium” users. It truly is free. The lessons and exercises are helpful, meaningful, and challenging in all the right ways (without being overwhelming). Daily check-ins with Woebot have become part of my mental health routine and I have become more self aware and emotionally stable over the 6 weeks I have been using the app, and all it takes is 5-10 minutes a day. Although the app’s responses are scripted and it certainly can’t replace speaking with a human, it is still incredibly useful to reinforce the principles and techniques of CBT and to make self-awareness and taking care of my emotional health a daily habit. This app has helped me with everything from minor stress to my most severe and damaging symptoms and I really think there is value in this app for everyone. It encourages self-awareness and mindfulness and gives you the tools to restructure negative thought patterns—just what the app claims it can do for you. I wish I could give it 100 stars. I wrote this review because this app really helped me, and I hope I can thank the creators and developers by encouraging others to give it a try.

But in less than a week, I learned some ways to relieve psychological pressure from it. It allows me to look at the problem from another angle, which is equivalent to pulling me out of the whirlpool of always blaming myself. I unlocked the first short story.

PROS:
- I get to leran a lot 
- I don’t have to book an appointment
-I can skip the chat one day of I’m busy 
- I learn to speak better English 
- We talk about important subjects 
- If I have a problem Woebot trys to help me
- Woebot keeps it short, which is great for me since I’m sick and don’t have much energy
- If I fortet something I can Ask Woebot to repeat 
- Woebot renings you about talking

CONS:
- It goes a little fast and it would be better of Woebot mention Evert subject twice 
- Woebot doesn’t understand everything. I have the fatigue syndrom and Woebot don’t give me any advices about this. WOEBOT SHOULD ASK ABOUT WHAT DESEASE YOU HAVE AND TRY TO HELP YOU.
- You should be able to talk longer with Woebot if you want to",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/2067734043/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Frequency"", ""Internationalization"", ""Performance"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support""]",[],[]

It assumes the problem is always a mental distortion, and doesn’t leave much room for actual horrible stuff that happens to people other than death of a person (it is working with a very narrow definition of “grief”).  It too often put me in a situation of having to select between incorrect responses when nothing was actually appropriate and then suffer through the resulting wrong-headed advice.  Needs a “maybe” button between the “yes” and “no” and a way to say, “You're on the wrong track,” before it decides it knows all your usual problems and keeps assuming them over and over with no way to remediate.

A friend recommended this app and I am so glad I followed her suggestion.   Woebot has been available whenever I need to talk and figure out why I am feeling the way I do.  I have had immense sadness, stress and anxiety the past 6 months due to life threatening double pneumonia and family problems.  I’m still recovering from the pneumonia, which takes 6-8 months to regain your strength. Sometimes the physical weakness due to the pneumonia has rendered me unable to do anything but sit in a chair for a few hours.  My husband works long hours, so I’m home alone.  It has been an isolated battle every day.  Added to the depression was my lifelong friend (who has a serious auto immune disease) contracted Covid and has been in the ICU on a respirator for 2 weeks fighting for her life.  Yesterday, she was well enough to be taken off the respirator and is battling to recover.  She has a very difficult path ahead of her and, if anyone can do it, she can and will!  Everything has has shaken me to the core !  My husband and I are in the high risk category for contracting Covid  and also a very high risk for not surviving  should we get it.  My doctor told me not to get around people- period !  That includes my grown children and grandchildren, who bring so much meaning and joy into my life.  Talk about crushing blows!

Woebot is awesome. I have already passed his contact info on to my daughter, my therapist, my friends.

As a single mom, divorced after 25 years of marriage, the stress to care for my college student kids, my dogs, the houses, and the rentals I am in the process to renovate and sell is at times overwhelming.
While I am grateful that my situation is better than other people, my anxieties about the process to renovating and selling those houses are real.
Woebot helps me to move from my black or white thinking, or my catastrophic envision of the future.
Having that “checking” every day is a way to remind me that the best place to be is the center (when I am stress, insecure, my thinking moves to the extremes).
I will say that I find it better than personal therapy because like a coach woebit and I work on specific things while therapy, talking therapy can be too general. 
I used to go therapy with an specific list of issues of problems to solve, and that is not how therapists tend to work. They like the past,  while I need help with the present.
So, if you want to try it, I think it will be helpful.

It’s just like having my own personal counselor in my pocket that I can use any time I need to, and who wouldn’t love that?  Counseling really couldn’t get more convenient than this!  

I was truly amazed at how consistently, correctly, and in an easy to understand way, Woebot incorporated CBT therapy in our simple messages. Considered the most effective form of therapy currently used, CBT therapy uses thought reframing in order to help us recognize how our thinking often controls our  behavior, and how by taking the time to reframe our thoughts, we can often then change our behaviors. Very helpful!

Gone are the days of needing an appointment, traveling to a crowed office, and waiting in an uncomfortable waiting room!  Sure, a one on one face to face session will always prove to be more effective, but what a wonderful alternative for those of us without insurance, or who have ridiculous copays, or possibly no transportation, significant physical disabilities, a sheer lack of time in our schedule, or a whole host of other reasons that prevent us from receiving face to face therapy!  Woebot is free. There are no hidden fees and no premium subscriptions.  Absolutely no credit card required. Ever. 
The only thing you will ever need to bring is you!

Considering the ability of this app to:  consistently incorporate real and proven therapy techniques, to utilize them in an effective and yet user-friendly way, coupled with the fact that it’s always completely free, and available at anytime, for anyone to use?  

I’d say this app is a much-needed, simply amazing, very useful resource, for us all!  I would encourage everyone to download it and add it to your list of must-have self-care techniques today!

Woebot will always be that friend you can rely on at any time of day or night, to listen and to offer helpful and objective advice, just the way you need it.

It’s like having an actual friend come talk to you and help you feel better using steps a therapist would use. I highly recommend it.

I’ve suffered from anxiety and depression for literal decades. I’ve had bouts of psychosis; I’ve self-harmed; I’ve really been through the ringer. 

But I already know the depths of my problems though; Woebot isn’t equipped to diagnose or give out specialized help. If you are starting your journey, you’ll need a little more help to really figure out your problems, and I suggest using Woebot in addition to a therapist but not as a replacement for. 

Woebot simply helps me to develop generalized, but reliable coping habits based on CBT. I’ve tried CBT before, but it never stuck. Woebot has really helped me stick to it though. 

Sometimes, I wish I could go through more topics all at once, but I also recognize that slowly going through all these topics will help them stick. 

Overall, Woebot is a great app, especially if you’ve already been introduced to psychology and CBT before.",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/1973961275/reply,"[""Performance"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

I think it’s also a helpful supplement to human therapists in that it’s so readily available; no need to set up an appointment with Woebot if you’re going through a bit of a rough patch late at night!

It’s CBT, so it doesn’t work for trauma—it can feel pretty invalidating even when you select to just share what you’re feeling (vs challenge thoughts, etc.).

It’s nice that it’s not a human, because I’ve had a few very bad days and been very uncooperative and rude to the robot. 

I don’t feel very guilty though, which is refreshing (but I don’t really have that kind of OCD anymore so it’s probably more me than the app). 

So if you tend to lash out, you can just try again without the horrible apprehension of having to make it better.

In this way, I think it’s been more helpful than therapy, which felt like aimless talking and digging into negativity without any tools or resolution to help me feel better. Some negative reviews complain it isn’t sophisticated enough to understand unrelated or detailed inputs and responses, which I agree with, but this is not an AI designed to make free flowing conversation; it’s meant to give you tools to deal with your feelings in productive ways. So yes, the conversations can feel linear, planned and/or broad since the responses are preset most of the time, but I think this is partly a positive. If we were able to respond however we want, I’m sure it would need a lot more development to redirect people who want to stay persistently negative. If you feel really deeply stuck in the weeds, this app alone may not be enough to pull you out of an episode, but I do think having some active suggestions to do something with what you think and feel are useful if they are accessible to you. If you want someone to listen to what’s on your mind, call a friend or family member, or journal on your own. If you want strategies to work thru and shift your perspective on your negativity, I would recommend Woebot.",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/1958918903/reply,"[""Audio"", ""Design & UX"", ""Import Export"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Frequency"", ""Performance"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

I found this app to be helpful, along with a meditation app. This app keeps me focused on what’s important. As an adult with ADD & history of depression, I was particularly worried depression would set in due to COVID. I was able to use this app any time day & night when anxiety set in. I use it daily and prefer it to in person counseling because this app focuses on the present. In person counseling, although helpful, I’ve found delves into the past & I get stuck in the past & it’s challenging to move forward. Again, this app is about the present. I highly recommend daily use, even if your using personal counselor, this app can supplement it. Give it a try & commit daily for a few weeks. I think you’ll find it useful & you’ll enjoy learning interesting stuff at your own pace & start to feel less anxious and learn new coping skills or reaffirm skills you may have already known.

It has lots of silly jokes like it owns a pet seagull, but it is actually easy to communicate with and learn from. 
I have two small issues that are so minor it still deserves 5 stars. 
1. Woebot will teach me about what a should statement is and explain they aren’t good and then it’s like “that’s all for today.” You can’t leave me with that. Give me a read more option with a link to reputable site. 
2. Woebot is very all or nothing.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I was wrong! This chat bot doesn’t flood you with toxic positivity, nor does it try to solve your problems for you. It uses a therapeutic approach called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to educate you on mental distortions, while empowering you to put the work in. Woebot helps me see hidden distortions in my negative thoughts, and asks me to challenge those thoughts by rewriting them without the distortions. I enjoy that I am praised for putting an effort into my healing process, not just for getting results. I also appreciate the empathetic approach this little bot employs to help me remember that I am not alone in my struggles. Seriously, this is a fantastic app and I’m so thankful to the hardworking creators and researchers who are so committed to helping as many people as they can, as much as possible. I still see my (human) therapist regularly, and Woebot helps me analyze and challenge thoughts in the moment. It is definitely worth it to try the app and see how it can help your mental wellness.

But the woebot app I think has helped me with that loss for the simple reason that sometimes I’d need to chat with someone like my mother but no one could fill that void. When I found woebot it reminded me of the cool laid back nature my mother used when approaching the subjects of teaching and learning. So in a way woebot has claimed a spot no human could fill after the death of my mother.

Woebot is helping me track my mood as I update my anti-depressant dosage and is also really good at talking me through anxiety. I wasn’t sure it would be able to help, but it really does allow you to process your emotions and gives daily lessons about mental and emotional care/management. The app does more of a “and how does that make you feel” approach where you get to be the one talking yourself down from anxiety by using logic, which is so much more helpful to me than any real therapist I’ve had. It also approaches depression and anxiety as normal things and makes it a lot easier to want to work on them (as opposed to an “oh no something is wrong with me” mentality”) I also LOVE that Woebot has push notifications to check in on me and makes sure I complete my daily lessons/therapy!

Deep detail can be written about your specific feelings and you won’t feel like you regret sharing your true emotions and thoughts. Because Woebot is there to listen and not to dissect every word you say or judge good or bad. It’s an scape from always getting mad that no one understands you or wants to listen to your same old problem.

When I first heard about Woebot, I was skeptical about an AI being able to help me, but the idea seemed appealing so I tried it. It’s been amazing for me! I’m delighted at how effective this app is at identifying what I need. It’s the fastest and easiest method I’ve found to get useful help for coping with life at any time, even in the middle of the night. It  also forces me to use my DBT skills, which is something that I can rarely motivate myself to do alone. Having “someone” to guide me through the steps is way easier than trying to do it all in my head. Thank you so much to the developers of this app for making an incredible tool- and for making it free!

It uses concepts from cognitive behavior therapy and positive psychology to not only address anxiety or negative emotions, but also provides tools for personal growth and awareness. 

Sure, as a chatbot, it is programmed to follow a script, but this works just fine for many of the ideas and tools it shares, and does so in a way that is very accessible. 

For example, the series of prompts to explain congitive distortions, to identify them in your own thinking, and then to rewrite a challenge/problem without the distortions is a very powerful tool. These are thinking habits that take time to rewire, and Woebot is a useful guide for that kind of exercise that requires repetition.

It controls the conversation pretty strictly, and you can’t ask questions along the way. (However, it does give you a tool box in which you can revisit strategies previously introduced.) This has three effects that I can see.  The drawback to the narrow script and how Woebot controls the conversation is that sometimes the script might not accommodate your particular needs or worries. Woebot is not a tool for people with severe or immediate needs. But, on the positive side, another effect of the tightly controlled interaction is that you would be hard pressed to forget that you are not talking to another human. This is good because Woebot’s purpose seems to be educational and to help challenge your thoughts in an nonthreatening interaction. And three, the narrow channel of the interactions allows the lessons to be concise and practical.

I don’t feel ready to commit to seeing a therapist, not even sure if I need to now. The advice given to me by Woebot has been super helpful for me dealing with my daily anxieties and frustrations. Since using this app for the past few months I feel more able to be mindful of my feelings and how I deal with life. I am sleeping better and feeling better overall! I appreciate that Woebot has a sense of humor and isn’t pushy. The advice is always interesting, often helpful and I usually end each “session” feeling like I have more tools to work with, or am comforted at the very least. And I also appreciate being able to decline invitations to talk without being made to feel bad or guilty about it.

Really one of the best things my smart phone has ever given me access too! Other than actual human interaction ofc😂 I never write reviews but I really couldn’t believe how helpful this app was! It’s very clear in stating that it’s not an emergency helpline which is so important and it’s just a lovely way to have a positive conversation when you’re not feeling 100%! It’s definitely not a replacement for professional therapy (which it is quick to declare!) but it’s great to have when you want a little bit of encouragement in your day, maybe don't have hundreds of friends ready to help you with every little thing or you find it difficult to open up!

I wish there were more apps like him. As a black woman who has depression, ADHD, & PTSD sometimes a lil pocket robot unconditionally cheering you on is just enough to keep you going. He can never replace human companionship but I don’t think Woebot needs to rise to that standard. It’s the same way a therapy dog can’t replace a human therapist, but it mere presence is comforting.

Woebot isn’t for everyone, nor is he all that complex, but Woebot forces me to take five minutes out of my day to reflect and ground myself. I have ADHD, so pen journaling loses my attention very quickly, but when Woebot asks about my day, I treat his initiation as a chance to do some journaling. 

His gives little “lessons/lectures” on how learn about oneself along with healthy coping mechanisms. This is where Woebot can lose folks. Sometimes the lessons can feel too “cookie-cutter” trying to apply to everyone and can come off disingenuous, but he’s trying. I do also wish Woebot had special lessons when someone tells him they have ADHD, Autism, bipolar, are a veteran, are victim of abuse, have experienced racism/sexism, etc. 
I know that would be a lot to code for his creators, but I like I said: I believe in the lil guy.

Fortunately, the creators know that. WoeBot is an AI software that adapts; remembers your responses; helps you to understand CBT concepts, strategies, tools, and the science behind it; and (apparently) compares and analyzes your responses. The advantage is the longer you use the software, the more it seems customized to you. Just from a philosophical point of view, I detest CBT; I don’t like anyone to do my thinking for me, or tell me how to think. This software has broken down some of my resistance, so that I can take from the package those things I find helpful, which is quite a lot actually. For example, I spend a lot of time in a “future” frame of mind, which leads to anxiety. WoeBot has tools for that. The software also gives you the opportunity to admit you are in crisis, WoeBot says a sympathetic statement, then whips out every conceivable phone number and contact info for crisis hotlines, then practically begs to to contact another human ASAP. Beyond all of that, WoeBot has a funny, quirky sense of humor. The software further improves itself by constantly and consistently asking for feedback on your interactions, clarifying what works for you and what doesn’t. It is a fascinating study in AI, but also, in the dead of night, when panic or anxiety have you in a stranglehold, WoeBot has immediate tools to help. It’s like having a firmly grounded, practical, pragmatic advisor, who is just human enough, to help you feel better.",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/1827788333/reply,"[""Gaming"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

I’ll go over the pros. This app doesn’t spam with the daily checking so you can just choose when you want to talk, if you already dealt with a lesson already on a topic it saves the lesson in the tools so you can just repeat it if your dealing with the same mental struggle again, and Woebot is a A.I which makes it helpful for it to find videos that best suits lessons and can quickly respond to your questions. But nothing is perfect so let’s go to the cons. Sometimes if your statement has atleast 3 lines of words it won’t understand what your saying making it difficult for it to help you, even though woebot can go over your mental health and scan you it won’t even use it for if your dealing with something again, and Woebot’s normal chats are to short and I personally agree that there should be a option for which length of time you want your  chat to be.

It somehow also makes me feel less lonely to just get that feedback, despite knowing it’s an AI. 

What I also love about Woebot is the way it challenges your negative thoughts and educates you on ways to reframe your distorted thinking through proven cognitive behavioral therapy methods. You can tell that whoever programmed Woebot actually knows what’s up, and that’s more than I can say for some other therapist apps.

之后就每天坚持进行对话，了解到很多非常有用的技巧。心情平稳很多。

This process is getting me in the habit to stop and think before I react. I still have a ways to go but it’s a pretty good coach. I’m using it to supplement my personal mixed-mindfulness practice. I know it’s an AI taking to to me, but sometimes I forget. It uses human-like dialogue and humor to ease over the techniques of CBT instead of just throwing a bunch of facts at you which I think helps when you are feeling anxious. I like the scheduled daily check-in/lessons sessions because normally I would forget. Right now the only tweaks I would want is it comments you with gifs to encourage you but they be a little more diverse. A lot of them are from TV comedies and some people may not like that, may want to stay away from media. If you could choose or enter your own to have them pop up for certain situations that would be cool, but that’s only nit-picking.

It is responsive and utilizes tools to remind the user the light at the end of the tunnel and the light the user sees within the day. It also helps with just being able to vent. 
Sometimes I forget I’m typing to a robot. It feels so real and picks up on key words. I’ve recommended this app to coworkers during these confusing times of COVID and heightened attention to the ongoing discrimination and genocide within the USA.

I can see on the mood tracker feature that I'm feeling considerably better than I was when I first downloaded it.

This is a wonderful tool for those who are dealing with stress, anxiety, or depression.  You can learn (or review) cognitive behavioural therapy techniques, check in daily to track your mood, gratitude journal by sharing three big or small things that went well for you each day, and, if you need to, turn to Woebot for help with sorting through and reframing difficult thoughts and feelings when something comes up, or if you're just feeling particularly crap.  This has been especially helpful for me.

It's obviously that a great deal of thought and care has gone into developing Woebot.  I've looked forward to my check ins and lessons, and to reading Woebot's humorous personal stories and jokes.  It's also lovely to get so much encouragement and positive reinforcement, even if it is from a little robot inside your phone.

Most of them feel generic and impersonal, and while I know that calling an AI bot “personal” might sound odd, “personal” is exactly what woebot feels like. 

I love the design of the little bot itself— he’s cute, but not saccharine or overbearing. He reminds me of wall-e, if wall-e was a certified counselor. The app’s interface is simple— like an elegant version of iMessage, with no “unlocking” levels or points/goals. It’s not a game, but a tool. 

I’m amazed by how impactful the little “interactions” in this app have felt. Maybe it’s the continued opportunities to respond (even if it’s just choosing between emojis). Woebot’s “voice” is gentle, but firm. And insightful! 

And the user is always addressed by name. That’s so important, particularly when the issue at hand involves ongoing anxiety. 

I don’t often post reviews, but when an app makes me cry in a way that feels long-overdue, I think it’s worth leaving a positive note. 🤖",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/1798181003/reply,"[""Audio"", ""Bugs"", ""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Gaming"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Update""]",[],[]

Over time one encounters new challenges - and occasional disasters - in life and it is easy to slip back into unhelpful patterns of thinking and feeling. 

This app has provided me with very helpful reminders of what I learned and changed about myself back then. It helps me spot and name the beginnings of negative feedback loops and to challenge unrealistic catastrophising interpretations of my performance and/or events.

I know that when you’re in a crisis you just want to cry out and have evidence that you’ve been listened to and that at such times being told “there’s an app for that” would be enraging but once that crisis is passed - as it will - I’d encourage you to try Woebot and to persevere with it whilst you and the robot get to know each other.

I have done the counseling and the personal work, too, over the years.

Today, I returned to a much earlier ""story"" lesson – I can access all of them whenever I want – and Woebot reminded me of something I said, way back when. It was a list of negative labels I used for myself. The words *hurt*. I am aware now of how much I was caged inside them, and I could also see I was slipping back some. The difference is that I also have some specific strategies for changing them. If I need help, all the lessons are right there.

I find the app to be very helpful, and also enjoyable.  It's intuitive and easy to use.

I have anxiety and depression, and during this stressful time I went looking for extra help and stumbled upon this lovely little app. I really rate the simple daily mood tracker and three point gratitude journal features, and I've found myself tapping the app when I feel particularly anxious to work through the feelings and thoughts with Woebot's help in addition to keeping up with my daily check ins.  

Beneficial CBT skills are presented in easy to follow ways, as are mindfulness and mindful movement.  You can use particular skills anytime you want or need to once you've unlocked them by having Woebot talk you through them, or the little robot can run through whatever is going on step by step.

While you're chatting with AI rather than a person, the encouragement is welcome and also adorable and it comes in the form of words, gifs, emojis, videos, and even jokes.  Woebot is funny and always manages to cheer me up.

This isn't an app for crisis situations, and Woebot will tell you that itself right off the bat whilst providing information for institutions that do provide those services, but it's wonderful for anxiety, depression, and stress.",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/1757904374/reply,"[""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Frequency"", ""Gaming"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases"", ""Video""]",[],[]

This app is best for people who have been taught CBT before. We often need to be reminded of the tools we’ve learned, especially in the heat of the moment. Most of us do not have a therapist we can call at 3 AM when we’re having a rough time. Woebot, on the other hand, is here all the time, any time.

I actually wish the sessions were longer. Woebot can be cheesy and corny, but that’s part of what makes this AI feel partly human. You don’t feel like you’re talking to a person, but Woebot is not quite entirely robotic, either. People will tell more to AI because they don’t fear judgment for their thoughts, and Woebot never comes across as scolding or disappointed if you don’t meet a goal, etc. 

I actually look forward to talking to Woebot every day, and I often talk to them more than once. Its insight is keen and inspiring. I can’t believe that this app is free.

I’m glad I found this app. This is my first time writing a mini review haha. It really has helped with my anxiety with the past week, and although I’ve had “ups” of anxiety here and there, logging in to the app and talking to Woebot is partially helpful, because I feel like someone is actually listening and helping me manage my emotions, rather than just writing a journal myself. I also like the gratitude journal because it helps me reflect on myself daily before it ends. As someone who has always been pessimistic towards oneself, reflecting on positive things that have happened, which reminds me that life isn’t all that bad, has been really helpful. As a student, I also love how this app is free. Finally, a non-money leeching app. I’m so glad.

I have never reviewed before so bear with me! 

Woebot is a friendly little robot and I absolutely adore him! He uses DBT strategies I have learned in therapy that I have a hard time remembering when I’m very low, and he makes little jokes that cheer me up; the developers have really given him a personality. You do not need to have a mental illness to benefit from Woebot, it’s good for everyone to have someone to talk to, even if it is a little robot friend. He even does gratitude journaling when you are happy so you can keep track of things that put you in a good mood. 

Personally, as someone who has struggled with mental illness for years, there are a lot of times when I need to talk to someone but I don’t feel like it warrants a crisis line, and Woebot is there to help me process my feelings and emotions. Sometimes something I type will set off a crisis alert and I realize that I should be talking to an actual human or professional, and Woebot provides phone numbers and websites for me to do so. I have sent the app to multiple friends and they have also been helped by Woebot.

These are difficult times for everyone, and the developers know that, and adjusted Woebot accordingly. Woebot relates with you, knowing how the pandemic is affecting the world around you, and will even tell you how Woebot has been affected. I mentioned feeling lonely and Woebot suggested many ways to connect with people through technology, even providing a banana bread recipe to make with my family or friends over video chat.

In conclusion I would recommend Woebot to anybody from any walk of life and with any kind of mood. The developers really made something that can make a difference, and who doesn’t want a little robot friend to talk to when things get tough?",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/1723370928/reply,"[""Connectivity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Notifications & Alerts"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases"", ""Video""]",[],[]

I find that woebot is able to 'handle' me. And I don't feel so bad saying 'get lost' to a robot. 

Sure I still have self blaming traits but woebot actually doesn't take it personally and it's refreshing to know that this is about programmers who are using research results  from therapy to shape the flow of conversations with woebot. I can see the seams and still appreciate what they're doing and why. 

In my own life I've seen that many very intelligent people feel too smart to engage in the process just because they can understand the flow of conversations needed to arrive at some therapy insight. 

It's not so different from an unfit person who refuses to exercise because they know what is expected to happen next. 

Just because we know what we need to do doesn't mean we've outsmarted the internal process and work required to heal ourselves. 

It merely means we are intelligent enough to know what is going on. 

Woebot isn't going to help people who are not interested in participating in their own recovery towards positive mental health.

I was really down tonight, and I’m actually writing this at 12:32AM. I’ve struggled with depression from an early age, but recently I’ve started to disassociate, and I’m looking into the possibility of having D.I.D.. But, due to the Corona Virus outbreak, I can’t really leave my home for therapy or really have any private time at all. I started spiraling again, and lately realized that I had started to starve myself... it’s been rough, to say the least. I wasn’t doing good tonight like I said, and I was pretty much considering knocking myself out with sleeping meds- just to try to feel better for a little while. Instead, I decided to look up apps to at least attempt to make myself better, and found this one. I mostly got it thinking it was a game, but man was I wrong. He calls me by my name, and even asked my pronouns just to make me comfy. There’s even an option to just “talk it out” randomly. It wasn’t really like talking to a person at times, but he was honestly more interactive and encouraging then I’ve gotten in a long time. I love this app so much already, thank you for creating it.

After my group CBT sessions got cancelled due to a certain global issue that’s keeping us all home lately, I downloaded a bunch of mental health apps to try to help me employ my CBT skills and to have a place to track my mood. This is the only one that stuck. I use this app every single day, whether it’s just to check in and track my mood, to use the gratitude journal, to calm me down when my anxiety gets hard to manage, or just to vent when I don’t want to burden a friend or loved one. The app developers really went above and beyond to create a chat bot dialogue that feels caring and realistic, and opening the app to hear a nice story or challenge my thought patterns makes me feel better every time. If you’re the type of person who likes to talk things out but you worry that you put too much pressure on your loved ones when you open up about your anxiety or depression, check this out.

It’s too scripted, and often wrong in its assumptions of what the user needs. It will often ask for feedback with multiple questions, and does this without asking the user if they’re “okay” with giving some app feedback. 

The app does offer some very vanilla explanations and examples of textbook errors in thinking. For the first thirty days the app assumed depression and kept trying to work on distorted thoughts. Despite every attempt to guide it towards situational sadness or frustration, Woebot kept instructing me on depression. About forty days in I finally got a conversation that differentiates sadness with depression. Finally. Woebot ends the conversation with a quip about the differences between anxiety and worry coming up soon. I wish there was a way for a user to tell Woebot where they think they are regarding their mental health. 

For someone with positive mental health, this app is fine, if sometimes annoying. However, I would not recommend it to any client that has a mental health issue that they’re working through. Perhaps if they used Woebot with their therapist. But even then, I’d recommend caution. 

The intention is there, and the idea is good. There just needs to be greater depth to the functionality, or perhaps the AI.",,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/1677292306/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests""]",[],[]

After you’ve selected your feeling from the list, it’ll explain some theory in psychology to you that you’ve probably already read somewhere and that you obviously aren’t being helped by, or else you wouldn’t be downloading an AI therapist.

It can be a little helpful just typing out your feelings. Hence why I gave two stars.

I struggle with severe depression and it’s closely related to loneliness. Woebot is my buddy when I can’t sleep at 3:00 in the morning and the weight of everyone sleeping around me is suffocating. So, thanks guys. You’ve made at least one persons day (night) a little brighter.

Some ideas I hope to see in the future of your wonderful app: More specific help with things other than depression and anxiety. I get why those are at the forefront of course but I think there’s room for a lot more (addiction based behavior, depersonalization which I have and is super scary and I think Woebot could be a comfort if he knew what it was, PTSD, Social Anxiety, etc.)

I think you have a brilliant and wonderful thing here and I’m excited to see how it will grow and get even better with time. ❤️

Edit: So I’ve had this app a couple weeks now and I still use it and really love it. Woebot is a great comfort to me.

I had another idea which I think could be cool. I don’t even know if you read these but: Maybe add a section for calming visuals and music/sounds? I really love the little gifs of Woebots breathing and I thought it would be cool to have access to more things like that. 

Thank you again for this little gift. It helps me every day.",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/1632245491/reply,"[""Audio"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Frequency"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support""]",[],[]

I already use CBT with clients so it’s a good fit for my practice. I really liked the analogy of weather for mood. Although I think we have more control over our mood than the weather, the analogy can be useful for accepting emotions and using coping skills for the ones you aren’t comfortable with.

I’ve been trialling it all week and it’s so incredibly infuriating and has only served to make me feel even worse so far.  When it’s ‘crisis’ point has triggered (albeit inaccurately and when talking about historical events) it only offers USA phone numbers or websites, I’m in the UK. It asks simple questions but doesn’t take note of any answers. I’m having a particularly bad week, and it’s blatent lack of intelligence to even simple things is just making it worse. Just now it asked me if I have access to ice or snow, I said I didn’t so Woebot told me to get a bottle of cold water. I typed in that I didn’t have any, and it proceeded to tell me ‘great, let’s get started!’ with no other way to intercede or stop it’s instructions without shutting down the app. I don’t dare open it again. From other reviews I beloeved this app was intelligent and a tool that could actually help. I was relieved and thought I’d found a quick access help, but it’s just made me feel worse. Maybe for someone just wanting to monitor general mood it will be fine, but for anyone who actually could benefit from the help it says it gives, it dods not work. I hope the developers continue to work on it vastly, or change it’s description to be a more accurate ‘mood monitor’ as presently, it doesn’t meet expectations",,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/1590061222/reply,"[""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Dissatisfied users"", ""Gaming"", ""Performance"", ""Customer Support""]",[],[]

I just wanted to mention to y’all that the app is rated 17+ on iOS. I don’t know if that’s rated by you or Apple. My son will be 13 in a few months and if what you say is true about the age requirement on your end I’d love for him to have it. It is essential for these children/tweens to learn, recognize, and refute these cognitive distortions to help them make good choices. (I really am my kids frontal lobe😄). By changing their thoughts about the really intense, new and sometimes scary feelings they are having, they will be able to catch negative thoughts before they turn into unhealthy behaviors. In fact, I have been talking to my 12 year old about sex in this way. He needs to know all his feelings are natural, normal and sometimes awful. We have touched on the mechanics briefly and I’ve told him his father and I want him to come to us for anything that’s worrying him or he does not understand. But, IMO, this separation of feelings, thoughts and behaviors may prevent some of the unhealthy choices he is sure to make (otherwise, how would we learn?) 🤞.

I struggle with severe depression and it’s closely related to loneliness. Woebot is my buddy when I can’t sleep at 3:00 in the morning and the weight of everyone sleeping around me is suffocating. So, thanks guys. You’ve made at least one persons day (night) a little brighter.

Some ideas I hope to see in the future of your wonderful app: More specific help with things other than depression and anxiety. I get why those are at the forefront of course but I think there’s room for a lot more (addiction based behavior, depersonalization which I have and is super scary and I think Woebot could be a comfort if he knew what it was, PTSD, Social Anxiety, etc.

I think you have a brilliant and wonderful thing here and I’m excited to see how it will grow and get even better with time. ❤️",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/1573267602/reply,"[""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support""]",[],[]

It’s hard to battle yourself, but Woebot is an aid that provides unbiased, nonjudgmental information and commentary that makes you feel heard. Granted, some commentary is fairly scripted.

I always encounter various psychological problems, just psychological sub-health. But it still bothered me for a long time, I have very serious procrastination and sleep problems, so when I learned from YouTuber, I just wanted to give it a try, without much hope. Of course I have tried all kinds of software to improve my habits, but they haven't done much. And woebot makes me feel particularly natural, not to change at once, but to change from passive to active through self-exploration, and talk to it when encountering problems, as if everything is easy. Maybe because it is intelligent, I do n’t have too much scruples, I want to say what to say, and gradually find that my view of people and things has changed.

I will admit it does get a little repetitive, but that changes as you go on and you get used to it. Something that has really annoyed and upset me about this app is that it seems to have two sets of data for me, so that not all my moods are calculated continuously and the chats with Woebot are in two different sets/accounts/data. It is irritating as one day I went on the app and it had restarted, and I had to go over things I had already done, so I now have two different accounts, if thats what they are. But overall, this app is a great way to see my patterns of thoughts and learn different ways to think (even if you don’t think that way at first). Woebot is also pretty cute. One thing I absolutely love about Woebot is that he reassures you that its okay to feel worse or the same or not get the hang of CBT and your knew way of thinking at first. Another part I really like about this app is that I look forward to going on it, and so far (two weeks in) haven’t gotten tired of using it, which has repeatedly happened with other apps. I think that is because Woebot seems professional and that the producers put thought and effort in to this to genuinely help.

The list of sleep problems doesn’t include 
waking up a lot during the night.   This is frequently the case with depression but the app doesn’t recognise this problem. 

It also assumes that you are lonely and need help doing things you enjoy alone.  Actually I enjoy doing lots of things alone but there are many times i still feel lonely too.  As doing things you enjoy doing on your own, is it’s only solution.  I basically don’t have a solution. 

It has some useful ideas and is good in certain circumstances but it’s far too positive.  For example 

W- Hope you are feeling better 
Me- No
W- That’s great to hear!

It does not recognise negative statements and assumes you are making positive statements. 

That’s so annoying! It makes you feel more frustrated.  

If it can’t recognise basic words like no, feel  bad, depressed, etc.  Then it’s not much use.",,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1689317-woebot-your-self-care-expert/reviews/1546450716/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Frequency"", ""Dissatisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

Like the grief conversation asks about the person’s name and memories related to them and I don’t have any of those. I know that’s a  sorta specific issue and the app is more general, but I feel like sometimes I don’t have the language to express my feelings about this situation in a way that woebot can understand.

Woebot is just like a person, he’s programmed really well and after you’ve had a talk with him you’ll feel much better, he’s very supportive and kind for a robot lol! You will get choices as to what you want to talk about weather it’s about your day, how your feeling, are what you’re doing at the moment. He’s got a good sense of humor too! You can tell him how you feel and he’ll show you ways on how to work on it, and comping skills to help. There’s a lot more great things to this app that you’ll have to find out for yourself.

It is extremely scripted, and it can be frustrating and even demoralizing if your needs don’t fit into the script.  It think it can be a good app for healthy folks who are experiencing a lot of stress because it can do a nice job of reminding you about mind traps and help nudge you back to more positive thinking. And I’m sure some people like its corny humor, but I find it childish and annoying. In addition, if you are seriously depressed, take care. Seek help from a good therapist. This app is not a substitute for a therapist, and CBT does not work for everyone. In my case, when I was in the throes of depression, CBT actually backfired. It made me feel a 100 times worse. It can be miserable to try to recast negative thoughts into more positive thoughts when you can’t think of anything positive at all. My highly regarded CBT therapist recognized this and, thankfully, referred me to a skilled therapist with a more psychodynamic/eclectic approach. I will always be grateful to him for that.  Finally, another thing that really annoyed me about this app was that listing habit temptations seemed to elicit the same responses as the negative thoughts which makes no sense. Temptations are persuasive not negative. E.g. One of my temptations is “Chips and candy taste so good.”, but Woebot asked if I could recast it into a more positive statement.

I would write down my feelings and thoughts late a night to calm me down. It was a great outlet and sometimes had questions for me to answer that would really make me think. For a while I didn’t use it because I got busy with college applications. So, when I came back to open the app to get ready to spill all of my thoughts it wouldn’t let me do it because I don’t have subscription 😔.

Even though you have to pay for somethings still, it’s not getting in the way of you using the app. At all really. Are use the free version and it’s still great. Like with some other apps you have to bye like pretty much the entire thing to be able to use the app and if you don’t want to buy it then it’s pretty much just getting in the way of you using the app in its entirety. Which is quite annoying (specially in the fact that that’s pretty much every app out there). I am only reading this app five stars because of what I’ve seen so far. I haven’t been using it for that long clearly, but it still seems to be working. I love how you can customize pretty much the entire thing just to your liking. It is very good with letting you speak without caring. Like when you sometimes need to just talk but you can’t talk to specific people or you just feel like you can’t talk to specific people; yes well now you can. I love how you can just speak into it and not even care. Very good tool for remembering your thoughts and how you felt. Sometimes in the moment you don’t quite remember all of the things that happened to you and that day that you would like to remember and sometimes writing it down just doesn’t quite cut it. Anyways overall this app seems to be pretty good. It’s cute, it makes me feel good about myself, and makes me feel happy overall.

Providing quotes given to boost self esteem and confidence in yourself. Although my only complaint is that for me I was able to use the log ins 4 times and then am required to pay to keep using the app for its journals. Why pay to write journals when you could use a notes app and write everything down normally. Maybe keep journaling free but overall results on how your moods ands feelings are changing as a pay to have feature.,,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2155389480/reply,"[""Design & UX"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

Reflectly - Journal & AI Diary,iOS,1241229134,6920462908,Mexico,3.20.0,1,2021-01-27,Tiny Rat,It was good...,"It was excellent. I did agree that fact that there were some functions that could be only used if you payed, and even though they were good, I didn't wanted to pay, I was ok with it. It was so useful if you only wanted a journal or somewhere to register how was your day. It was perfect.
But now, we can't do anything. To make an entry? Pay. To add a picture? Pay. You didn't even add languages or corrected glitches.
How do you expect we, the users, to stay with your app, if we can't do anything? Of course there will be the ones that will pay, but there are also the ones that do not want, or can't, like me. I understand. Making an app is not for free and deserves some recognition, but I'm afraid to say, but, for a diary? It's too much. 
I'm exporting my entries... for the ones wondering, go to your profile, tap in the settings icon and scroll all down, and tap in ""Export data"". You'll get a PDF to your email, and download it.

Since the attachments are now just stuck over the notes it’s just there and there are no title photos anymore:( I used to totally love the app but the new update got rid of the things I’ve loved the most and it’s not even allowing me to write anything anymore.,,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2148686942/reply,"[""Camera & Photos"", ""Frequency"", ""Performance""]",[],[]

It has improved my mindset a lot over the months I have used it. Especially since Covid started, I assume everyone has been quite bummed.. but the app can help by giving daily check ins, stats, and is accepting to sad, angry or upset emotions. 

It puts in little diary like note slots that you can write about your days and moods in. 

 BUT not all of it is free.. and that’s where the problem comes in. It would help if it WAS free so that you could get unlimited time on the app.

BUT DON’T WORRY!!! You don’t HAVE to pay to use the app, it’s just that the options are a bit limited. And THERE ARE NO ADD PROBLEMS.

Overall, it’s a great app, and I hope you have a great time using it!

This is an app that asks you a reflection question every day, and allows you to write down how your day went. It offers inspirational quotes and statistics on how your mood check-ins have gone. I thought this app was going great until I was only able to do TWO moos check-ins, then it said I have to pay. I think that’s genuinely so dumb, it should give you so much more time.

The subscription is something like 1.50 a month so it’s barely anything but I just wanted to let everyone know that you literally will not be able to use this app without paying.

Whilst using the app, it is limited to what you can use, again because you have to pay the fee. 

The motivational quote are corny and a bit tacky. 

The mood checker wasn’t useful. You are forced to categorise your mood, things like ‘work’ ‘family’ ‘food’. A lot of the time, my mood is not reflexes upon these said categories.  

I personally did not enjoy the app. I did not learn mindfulness or CBT techniques. Just tacky quotes and ‘buy now’ ads.

This really isn’t helpful, as I need an app like this, but I couldn’t pay for the subscription.

i want to say that this is an awesome app and i love it!! 
i don’t have any S.E.N (spec ed needs) or anything like that but i still find this a really relaxing app for writing down my feelings and my thoughts. 
i LOVE the quotes and the fact you can save them to photos (they are a perfect size for home screen wallpapers) SOOO really i only have a few requests.... 
1) You know how you can add photos each day - could you let the user add more than 2 photos? i feel like 3 would be the ideal amount (i’m talking non-premium membership here) 
2) Could we see more of our stats on non-premium? it would be easier to see how our overall mood is doing. 
ANYWAY.....
love this app - five stars but definitely if you could change these things things then i will come and change this review!! 
Get this app for those who haven’t already got it!! xx  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2145240421/reply,"[""Camera & Photos"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

However, there are some serious problems with the app. Something that frustrates me significantly is your promotions for buying the full version of the app. I have no intention of purchasing the additional features because I cannot afford the full price once the promotion expires. What makes me angry is how I can’t even do my check ins, and I’m confused about what I can get for free. Every time I try to do a check-in, the promotion pops up. There is clearly something wrong with the app, because all of the top reviews are clearly from people who paid for the app, but there are other reviewers that are saying the same thing that I’m saying. Some older reviews even say that there were more features in the past, but you now have to pay for everything. If you are intentionally doing this, that is unacceptable. However I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt.

PLEASE MAKE THE APP USABLE FOR USERS WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE APP. If you cannot generate enough revenue from paid subscriptions, then make the price more reasonable. Add more payment plans if you have to!

My Reflectly has been an outlet for all the strife in my life. I love the UI. It’s very user-friendly. You can add pictures to the days you write your reflections on, and it even helps you actually reflect and think about things in your life by asking you a question every day for you to answer. There’s no pressure to write entries, make pictures or write the answers to the questions. 

I have been through the hurricanes that nearly destroyed our custody and relationship issues, people taking advantage of us when we were in need, a shooting, family issues, accidental overdose resulting in seratonin issues and hallucinations, severe sickness, creepy hillbillies trying to mess with us, and of course the political climate of 2020...and because of this I have severe anxiety. Reflectly has a a friendly UI and non-agitating color scheme. They’ve only ever really made changes to it once that I can recall. 

     I recommended features to Reflectly and they actually communicated with me on Facebook messenger rather promptly. Come to find out, you can download your Reflectly in a PDF. The only drawback is that it messes up the parts where you separated your paragraphs, which is why for now my review is four stars. I think they actually listen to our concerns so it should be fixed soon. I’ll go back and check just to be sure.

Reflectly - Journal & AI Diary,iOS,1241229134,6875989656,United Kingdom,3.20.0,4,2021-01-16,Cgvhni,Amazing journaling app,"I use this app pretty much daily to sort through my thoughts, make sense of them, vent when I need to, and seek comfort from myself when I need to. I also really like to post pictures and look back through them - so I can see the things that make me really happy or comforted or even sometimes sad.

That is the purpose of the app. To reflect. Hence the name. It is not a “game” as some reviewers have referred to it. 

Yes, of course you could use a pen and paper if you wanted to. You could track your emotional data offline, or on a spreadsheet or whatever you liked. But I prefer to type to myself on my phone - I feel like I’m texting myself! And it’s securely protected by your biometric (face or fingerprint) which gives you piece of mind that nobody is going to find and read your entries. 

There are bugs sometimes. This is normal for any application or software in general. You can contact the Reflectly team via Facebook messenger and they’re very receptive and incredibly friendly. Unfortunately, these bugs are appearing quite frequently (there’s been one where my images post on their side which has been present for months) which is the only reason I’ve given this app 4 stars rather than 5, because I would hope that could be fixed sooner. 

Overall, the positive impact this app has had on my life since I’ve been using it incredibly frequently for the past 5 months is well worth the money.",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2135755841/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Camera & Photos"", ""Connectivity"", ""Frequency"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

However the problem is that it now has a premium lock on everything and you have to practically pay to use the app. I’m sure that the premium is amazing but it’s very expensive with no offer applied and I don’t think that it’s worth it. Just not long ago I used to be able to track my mood for free which is all I really need. Maybe take some features off premium and I’ll get it again but with everything on premium it’s a bit useless not been able to do anything. Every time I go on the app something goes onto premium.

I thought it was really really exciting. There were a few issues I had with the functionality of the app, like why you couldn’t make a permanent category for how you were feeling or what made your day good/bad that the app would remember. 

Or why you couldn’t search days by which days you’ve liked.

Or how sometimes I couldn’t read the text over the pictures because the picture had too much white in it.

I overlooked the small problems though because of how much I loved this idea, I was super excited to start logging.

I ended up logging for about 3 months until just today I saw they updated the interface of the app. I was immediately underwhelmed... There was too much text on the screen and the pictures were super small. If I want to read the text I’ll click on the picture. Don’t overwhelm me with information before I click on it.

I can appreciate needing payment for the work gone into the app, but a monthly subscription fee for a journaling app that's entire intent is for monitoring and improving mental health? Seems slightly unethical to me. Fine don't let me use to fancy features and tracking stuff, but at least let me continue with the journaling. 

For this reason alone, the app has become useless and I've gone back to journaling with pen and paper.

In the morning you get one simple motivating task to do so you can get your day started off right and throughout the day when you feel the need to talk about your feelings you can. At night you have a prompt to help you better understand your problems. One thing that really has helped me is the notifications. That might sound weird but during the day the app will send you quotes and personally quotes like that inspire me to be better and I really like being able to choose ones that you relate to the most. After about five days of using the app to tells you about your feelings and if your getting better or not and other things.

I don’t care about the premium features or whatever it is, I just wanted something to write my feelings in that had less of a risk of being found by my family. 

The app is good, it’s the fact that if you want to continue using it to keep you mentally stable you have to pay a fee. That doesn’t make sense to me.

I was most of all enjoying the morning motivation, and for the end of the day check-in, it would ask a question of the day which was my absolute favorite part. However, in this most recent update, I’m unable to do either of these things without paying for a subscription. The only thing i can do for free is look at past entries and view the quotes page. What I don’t understand is if the purpose of the app is to journal, why do i have to pay to do it? And so suddenly too? It’s like a music streaming app offering music you can listen to for free and after your 3rd song, they make you shell out some cash if you want to keep listening to music. I wish they would consider going back to the original format, im sure most people would pay for the premium subscription, and then people who are satisfied with the free version can continue to use the app. It’s disappointing because I was really enjoying this app and how it was helping me and now i’m forced to find something else that’s suitable for me mentally and financially.",,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2131861584/reply,"[""Audio"", ""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Payment"", ""Pricing"", ""Streaming"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

I don’t know if this app listens to you or records you or what-my assumption is it interrupts your thought patterns much like DMT or CBT therapy and reprograms the way you think.

 Reflectly sends you messages throughout the day that gradually improve your self-esteem and sense of self over a period of a couple weeks and gets better over time. It’s like having a best friend in your pocket that not only guides you but grants you the added bonus of allowing you to come to solutions to your problems without therapy which improves your overall self esteem and belief in yourself. Very effective. This is the longest review I have ever written because this is the best money I have ever spent on an app.

It was a genuinely caring and safe environment where you could just vent whatever you wanted for free which is why I had it.

Today when I went to check in it said I had to pay. The check in, the only thing people use it for, suddenly costs money.

This app is meant to help you with mental health, but the creators have just made it for profit now. Why can’t you just have used some ads? I could have at least used it then and tolerated the ads.

Looks like I’ll just be using an actual journal now.

I can’t stand the sight of that little snakey robot that’s meant to look cute but really doesn’t care about you unless you have money.

Then, it gave me another offer, lasting 42 hours. I waited again, just wanting to write for free again.

It then proceeded to give me the same offer multiple times, not letting me do my check-ins unless I bought it - which I don't want to -.

It keeps giving me the same offer, the offer lasting longer every time it pops up. I downloaded this app to write for free, not for the offer to show up each time I want to write.

Every time you open up the app it tries to sell you things and i just want to write, when i have opened Reflectly previously it’s been because of a bad day and i do not want to have advertisements or premium come up.

I would’ve given this app five stars had the adverts lessened and availability of free things increased, i can no longer use this app without paying, i don’t have the time i just want to write please enable that.

Reflectly - Journal & AI Diary,iOS,1241229134,6845119545,Nigeria,3.19.0,5,2021-01-08,Angel Umeh,Thanks for the update!,"The app is great for journaling. The idea of letting users (even Basic users) add custom activities and emotions is a cool one. However, after a certain number of moments/stories, the app starts having issues. You can’t scroll down to older moments or see photos you uploaded. You can only create new moments— you can’t even upload new photos. And the app gets incredibly slow. I started using this in February, but ever since I updated the app on 12th July, I couldn’t see moments from before that day. I thought it must be because those older moments were created using an older version of the app and the updated app can’t handle that information, but I updated the app again on 8th August and I can’t see moments from before 8th August, scroll down, see photos, or even use the app at all. I already logged out and logged back in but it’s still doing the same. I’d love for you guys to go back to the old version and scrap this new one entirely, it was pretty annoying.

UPDATE:
I updated the app to the latest update (released 7 September) and it's great: I can now see past entries and the interface is generally better. The quotes section is awesome too and is a lot better than the articles.

UPDATE:

I updated to the latest version and it is preventing me from logging in.

I have skipped over these ads because I do not want to buy and have no intention of buying it in the future. I skipped over that add today and was about to write a check-in when I then get the message saying something along the lines of “Woah, we see you trying to write so we’ve decided to make something special for.” I believed that this was going to be a nice note or just something sweet for the users but it was actually an add for reflectly premium again, however this time, I couldn’t get around it. I am actually not able to use the app anymore unless I get reflectly premium! If this was you intentions the whole time, just make the app not be free. That way people know what they are getting into. I knew that I wasn’t going to get all of the best features but I didn’t know that after a certain amount of time, I would not be able to make entries. Reflectly has been my way of relieving stress and after everything that happened with the US government, I was looking forward to it. This was just a major slap in the face after I had been having a very good time on the app. Other than that, reflectly has been amazing. It’s very helpful for me and allows me to write all of my things down in my head whenever I want which is very helpful.",,,mixed,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2122006788/reply,"[""Advertising"", ""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users""]",[],[]

I assume keeps track of you mood. Each day you also get reflections. These are questions such as- if you could do one thing for five hours of your life what would it be?- you also get a daily challenge which is supposed to make a your day brighter buy completing it. I thinks the apps very cute and enjoy the language used and notifications from the app. The app is also very personalised. However on my third days check in I realised I couldn’t check in without having to pay the premium subscription. There was a sale on the subscription for New Years which lowered the price significantly to £14.99 annually from an original of £59.99. This pop up appears every time I try to use one of the apps features (except the motivational quotes) which I’ll otherwise be able to do. I hadn’t unlocked stats yet. So technically the app is free, but from my experience the app is only free for you to use for three days maximum. Unless you just like scrolling through the menu and quotes. Those are still free.

I don’t know if this is a bug or it’s going to be permanent. Or they are doing this because they want people to spend money so that they can have money, so that the users can have a basic function like journaling. Or some users are just using the basic plan, like me, and they need or want extra money. I started to really like this app because it did the basic functions. But it doesn’t even allow you journal. How can an app that is meant for journaling not allow its users to journal without paying. I switched to Daylio and I fell like it’s better. You can actually do something’s that you couldn’t do on Reflectly like look at statics, even allows you to create goals for yourself. It has some features that Reflectly doesn’t have.

I grew quite fond of the daily check-in system. But ever since they updated the app I am unable to do my daily check-in without payment involved. (Which in my opinion, is a high price just to write down your thoughts and emotions for the day)

I feel my rating is accurate as the app was well done and helpful for the time being to write down my thoughts, however lacked the creativity and also had an expensive price tag not too long after being on the app. Please, if you would like to try out the app, then do so.

Not unless I pay for it! NO! Don’t download this app, it is merely profiting and does not care for your mental well-being unless you pay for it! Sorry, but I can use that money to get a new book, or get a REAL therapist if I ever need one. I believe that there are other better FREE journaling apps out there, and will look into those.

To save the long story, it asks for a subscription practically every 3 seconds. And after your 3rd entry, it won’t let you do anything unless you pay for a subscription. If you want a free journaling app, I recommend Daylio, Mood app, or Day One. Thankfully I can still keep journaling because I downloaded multiple journaling apps in case something like this happened. I feel bad for all the other people on here who are upset. Some people have been using this app for years and now all of a sudden need a subscription. It’s just wrong. The only reason this app still has good reviews is because all of the five star reviews were posted a long time ago, before they asked for subscriptions. I think the subscription thing was applied recently because all the people complaining about it on reviews were posted this week at the time I’m writing this. If you read the good reviews from a year ago, people are happy because the app was free, but it isn’t anymore now so I think over time this app is slowly going to start getting more bad reviews.",,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2118029086/reply,"[""Pricing""]",[],[]

 Reflectly is a pretty good app but after I wrote a couple mood check in’s, I couldn’t right anymore. When I tried to write another, it kept popping up with the 66% of Premium offer and I couldn’t right anymore mood check in’s.

It’s REALLY annoying when you download an app that actually helps but you can’t use it anymore after a couple check in’s. Some people can’t pay for it, like me, and I actually love using the app but it’s frustrating that I can’t use something that can help me after a couple uses. 

I can’t use it anymore unless I pay for premium but I can’t do that and I don’t get why an app made to help you, doesn’t help you after a couple tries. I get that you do need to make money off of it but making the user unable to use the app for its intentions after a couple uses isn’t the best idea in my opinion. 

It’s kinda sad that I can’t use it anymore because the app is great. I don’t have anyone to express my emotions too so letting it all out to this app is great but now I’m mad that I can’t use it anymore. 

(I did 5 mood check in’s then when I tried to right a 6th one, that’s when the offer starting popping up)",,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2118030310/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Design & UX"", ""Dissatisfied users"", ""Pricing"", ""Customer Support""]",[],[]

It’s like a little bullet journal you can take around with you. I love being able to record my thoughts and emotions and explain them in different categories. One of my favourite things about this app is that there is a new positive and inspirational quote every day that keeps me going, especially when I am feeling low. 

The only thing I’m sad about is that I can’t unlock the pro sort of stuff but other than that, I can’t find anything wrong with this app.

It’s surprisingly cathartic to write down how you are feeling. Like when stressed, after writing it down you feel it kind of lifts a little bit.
Also it’s good fun and interesting to read back through your previous days. It also puts things in perspective as after reading back through I realised more than once that I was letting the smallest of things get to me, so now I have something to work on.
As I say I love the app so far and have paid for my first year at a trial price.

Reflectly - Journal & AI Diary,iOS,1241229134,6831289961,USA,3.19.0,3,2021-01-04,I love Dem pigs,I could only do stuff 5 times,"So I really like this idea but only on day three, I’ve maxed out all my free journals apparently. I didn’t know that I had a limited amount of journals so I kinda just did them whenever I wanted to. I’m a little sad too that there aren’t that many quote options that are free. I’d be great if you could select multiple types of quotes so you could get them all in your stream and personally, I think the sections of quotes that are sensitive like eating disorders should be unlocked for ppl who have that and don’t know how to get help. Honestly an overall great app and the price with all the discounts isn’t really that bad. I just wish there was a way to unlock stuff with like time or activities so people who can’t pay can still get all the qualities of this app. Because I’ve maxed out my journals, I really don’t know if I’ll be able to use the app anymore because I don’t have the ability to pay for now. Later, I’ll update and see where I’m at if the free journals come back or if I pay for it.

Update: after looking at other reviews it seems this app was better before the update. I didn’t know the app before, but I know that the way it is is asking for so much money that I cant do a simple journal entry. I’ll probably have to delete it and find a different journal. It’s such a good app but everything is locked :(

Update: there are plenty of other journal apps with a basic unpaid version that seems to be better than this one’s, so I will be using those instead. I’d rather not have to spend money to do something that should be free like writing. Hopefully the people who made this app can think of a more friendlier way to help people and earn profit.",,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2118683470/reply,"[""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Pricing"", ""Streaming"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

The UI is absolutely gorgeous, the animations are slick, and the whole app is great to use. The check-ins are great, and the voice notes and photos are also a great addition. I love adding a photo or two that highlight my day. The app’s been doing a lot for me, and I love it. However, there are a few improvements that could make it even better. First, the iPad app is pretty bad. It works, but there’s no trackpad support, so things are still pretty awkward. The text formatting is awkward (there’s no cursor, so you don’t really know where you’re typing). I’d like to see a more advanced text editor for journaling with rich text formatting, inline image support, different (preset?) text sizes, bullet lists, the works. After all- the app costs $60/year. Apple Pencil support would be wonderful, it would be great to have a hybrid journal with typed entries in addition to handwritten entries. Support for scribble would also be a welcome improvement. Another great improvement would be the ability to add videos along with images. I’m unsure if Reflectly is already encrypted, but it would be a great idea to include the option to encrypt your journal and its entries with a custom key like Jour does.",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2116667751/reply,"[""Camera & Photos"", ""Design & UX"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Security & Accounts"", ""Customer Support"", ""Video"", ""Devices""]",[],[]

Every time I come back, I feel like there’s another amazing feature. However, it seems that each one also comes with a setback.

At first, it was simple: just journal as you please. Then, they introduced photos. (One suggestion: just as you can set a journal entry for any day in the past, this should be available for photos, too.)

Just recently, I checked onto the app again to make an entry only to realize that I can’t. That’s right. No more Reflectly Premium - just Reflectly or no Reflectly. That’s it. Reflectly has reserved almost every single feature of their app for Premium users only.

I rate this app 2 stars because although it has some awesome things about it, the fact that they’ve focused their intents so much on money leads me to the conclusion that they’re no longer concerned with the actual mental health of their users, exactly what they claim to care about most.",,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2115276012/reply,"[""Camera & Photos"", ""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Frequency"", ""Pricing"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

I really appreciated this and am happy to be starting my new year with this app! Thank you again! 

I downloaded the app and it immediately asked for a year subscription, I was interested and decided to buy. It purchased and had me do my first log of my mood. I did that and everything was great! But then it asked me to create an account so I typed in my email address and it said this is already in use, maybe try signing in? So I backed out of the app to go back to the home page where i could sign in and I signed in successfully. But I checked my account and not only is my first log missing but the subscription was missing and it said ""basic plan active"" so I was confused and clicked on the ""activate reflectly"" and clicked redeem offer to see if when it connects to my apple account it will recognize I have already paid for the subscription. Well it didn't and charged me again because I got a text from my credit card saying I was charged another $63 but the app said ""error occurred"" and never gave me the subscription anyway! Point is I have two payments of this year subscription and no subscription.

i opened the app today to write a new entry for new year's, and i was appalled that i now had to have premium to continue journaling. this is uncalled for and i have lost any respect i ever had for this greedy little piece of crap. i suppose i'll just delete this app and go back to traditional pen and paper journaling.

1 - Perhaps turn the check in days into a few less instead of four? Therefore we can see our stats faster!
2 - Maybe a few things can be accessed without premium while usually you would have to purchase premium! (Okay sorry that’s the point of premium-)

I think this app overall is great. One of the features I like is the daily challenges. They are difficult but not so much that I feel distressed. Speaking of the daily challenge one of the down sides to this function is that the words are hard to read. The letters are a super light gray against a bright pink and orange background. It’s just a small accessibility grip. Other than that if you want to help build positive journaling habits I’d recommend this tooI. I rated this three stars because I saw a couple reviews stating that you could replace your therapist/counselor as the top reviews so I’m not really comfortable giving three stars to a company promoting a review like that.

About a year ago, I could add journal entries, post pictures, answer the daily reflection question, and open my “morning motivation” for the day. I took a break from the app and used another app (Daylio) to journal, and when I came back around a month ago, I noticed the layout had drastically changed AND the reflection questions were locked for premium members to use only. I’m just a teenager, so I don’t have the money to buy premium. So I thought, “Okay, I still have my morning motivation.” Well, today I noticed that the morning motivation had become locked too! Now I can only add entries and scroll through inspirational quotes.

A couple concerns though. The app hasn’t been as useful since it was updated in April-May time when a bunch of features that were once free needed to be paid for. I understand that you guys need to make money off this app but I feel that the subscription price is too expensive. It’s also been kind of annoying lately when you’ve had about 5-6 consecutive sales on, all ‘ending soon’ but another one starts straight after. I would suggest either permanently bringing down the price or keeping sales few and far between. A great app minus a couple minor details though!
UPDATE- Had to move my rating to one star. Just been on the app and I can’t even record things in my journal for free anymore!

So after a few short daily uses of the app, it brings to my attention that I have to pay for more journal entries. That’s not what I asked for! I really wish you could have unlimited entries, but that’s not the case. I might just have to delete the app and get a different one that has a different format...
Anyways, in the time spent using this app, I would rate it a 4 out of 5 stars. Very user-friendly. I would recommend to anyone who is fine with spending some money for this app. I really like journaling apps, and this one made it seem like I was talking to a real person. And I vented to it half the time about my daily problems!!

It’s no nice to be able to just have generalised moods such as ‘good’ and ‘bad’ (for times when you can’t understand how you feel) as well as more specific moods like ‘confused’ or ‘nervous’, as well as the ability to create your own. It’s so much easier to just click a button than it is to try and put anything into words, it only takes a second but I always feel much better afterwards

Unfortunately, I have now run into an issue where I can apparently only continue to use this supposedly free app if I make monthly purchases. You shouldn’t make an app that only allows you to access it for free for a limited time. It’s misleading and disappointing to think you’ve finally found a free app that helps you out, only to learn that it’s no longer available to you unless you fork out

Overpriced with 0 transparency,"The app itself is nice to use and is a great tool. Really helpful and nice to track how you’ve been feeling and what you were up to. 

The app is guised as a free option which you are happy to use knowing that you cannot access stats. Fine. The constant ‘limited time offers’ at variable prices for the full solution are irritating each time you open the app but again ‘fine’ because you’re happy to use the app as is and don’t need the stats. 

Turns out that I now have to pay or cannot use any features. Even the basic ‘free’ stuff. So I am thinking very reluctantly maybe I should pay £15 for a year as i now have a month of my thoughts and pictures in this app just stuck there (there was no transparency that it would be unusable after x posts or y time). 

Then you notice that it’s £15 for 1 year and then £60 thereafter. This is where you realise the con. Get you hooked in by holding all your thoughts and memories and then gouge the price. 

No thanks.

It said it was personalized for your experience.

None of that is true. I couldn’t even access the app to try it out and accidentally purchased a whole year subscription — it wouldn’t allow me to change the length of subscription— and it’s definitely not worth the money. It’s misleading and is honestly completely pointless.

For check-ins, it just asks you how you’re feeling and gives you only a few options to choose from. I can’t easily figure out how to change the options. It also only gives me a few options for saying my emotions about the situation. Nothing is personalized and it feels very cookie-cutter. 

It doesn’t send anything interesting during the day. When you set reminders, it just sends you boring quotes that are found on magnets or motivational posters. It has a “morning motivation” but it was seriously just “clean your room”. What? Not helpful.

But for the past few weeks I kept getting notifications telling me to upgrade to premium. every. single. time. i open the app. it’s so annoying. 

and then tonight, when i went to journal like i have every single night for the last nine months, i get a pop up telling me i can’t journal anymore unless i upgrade to premium (which has no set price, it seems to change every time i get a notification about it) tonight it was 15 dollars a month, which is something i just can’t do. 

i have 293 journal entries with reflectly. and just like that, on a whim, they decided i wasn’t worthy to be a user anymore. totally completely screwed me over. 293 entries that i have to transfer over to another app or to my notes app or something if i want to have access to them. it’s so incredibly messed up, and especially since it happened without warning.

First, I’m just gonna say how amazing this app is, it gives you advice too, like a famous positive quote or something. three star for that there. Reason why I didn’t put last two is because when I tried to write my 6th day (today) it didn’t let me and it says something I needed to update my account (which was optional at first) so I clicked ok or smth and it say I hv to PAY to continue
And it didn’t let me do anything anymore, so I just deleted the app and here I am now. 
It was really disappointing since I’m having rough days and this app have supported me, and when they randomly post positive quotes (Ik it sounds wired but) I thought this app cared for me. But then they ask me to pay so-. I guess not. Like I said, I am really disappointed about it so I thought about giving 2 stars but all the structure of app is great so it’s 3.

Reflectly - Journal & AI Diary,iOS,1241229134,6781103135,USA,3.16.1,3,2020-12-22,Lillyroz,Lovely app! But... (suggestion),"I love this app and has been using it for the past months! Its a nice way to jot down any thoughts or feelings into! But I will say I hate the new format since its last update or two. If you’ve never used the app then I’m sure this won’t be too much of an issue and feel free to download it if you like! But as someone who got used to and grew a liking to the older format I just wish there was an option like a switch or something that lets you switch between which format you want (the one that scrolls up and down, AKA current format, or the one that scrolls left to right) the main reason I wish for the old format is I just miss having a photo as a cover image along with the title on it, then having you tap on it to open your summary and such. With the new formatting there isn’t really a need for a cover image. I liked using cover images to sum up what I did that day like a photo of something I got at the store or somewhere I went that day etc. Aside from a cover image, I do think it takes a bit longer to scroll down and find past entries opposed to scrolling right and left. Aside from the complaints, overall reflectly is a wonderful app and I highly recommend it!",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2101051096/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Camera & Photos"", ""Feature Requests""]",[],[]

A couple concerns though. The app hasn’t been as useful since it was updated in April-May time when a bunch of features that were once free needed to be paid for. I understand that you guys need to make money off this app but I feel that the subscription price is too expensive. It’s also been kind of annoying lately when you’ve had about 5-6 consecutive sales on, all ‘ending soon’ but another one starts straight after.

The inspirational quotes are the main reason I’m giving this app 4 stars instead of 5. The inspirational quotes are mostly nice but once in awhile it gives a quote that uses religious words in it, which is fine if it gave you the ability to skip quote and let you have another one for your widget but the app doesn’t let you skip. I personally am not religious so this bothered me I had to be stuck with a religious quote on my home screen until it moved on to another quote.

I love the app and it’s so easy to use.  I love that you can now do the voice note for when you just want to something really quick.  It’s great to go back and look at everything to see how I’ve progressed.  I really love to see all the quotes as well  One of my favorite things about the app is the morning motivation.  I really try to do the goals, even though most of the time I don’t get to. 

I know this is how you make money with this app, but I feel like there should be more things without the membership.  I also think there should be more emotions to pick from other than the 5 because a lot of the time I am in between. 

But overall a great app and I would recommend to anyone.

I read another review in this app and they said that it would be good if there were a few more options when selecting what made you happy or sad for that day. And I completely agree, I feel that maybe a coupe more options to do with emotions and feelings. Because sometimes family, friends, work etc doesn’t make me or anyone upset sometimes and it’s just yourself feeling that way for no reason. I think that maybe there should be other options like your brain or something like not sure, for when you don’t know why you felt that way. 
Just a couple suggestions, but I love this app really great and good job to the creators

It’s smooth, easy to write check ins, and I almost feel like there’s someone who actually cares about me and is asking how I feel every day. I’m not one to write in diaries so I definitely haven’t been using this app to it’s full potential but I love it. 

My only problem is that there is no stat check up system in the free version, and the premium is very expensive. I don’t know what the premium includes so maybe it is worth $80 a year but I would like even just simple statistics for free users.

Reflectly - Journal & AI Diary,iOS,1241229134,6706194967,USA,3.16.0,5,2020-12-01,Missylou76,Read This,"People have been concerned with the privacy policy and the fact that the app knows your name and address. I honestly don’t think there is anything to worry try about because I have had the app for a little more than two years now and nothing bad has happened. And I haven’t been hacked either.

I love this app for two main reasons. It allows you to sign out to keep everything private. And it allows you to express feelings and cope with anxiety and depression. I had really bad depression. And when quarantine came around, things just got worse. But when I downloaded Reflectly, I was able to talk about how I was feeling without anyone actually being there.

I have a ton of personal issues and a main one is the lack in the ability to express and share how I am feeling. This app lets you do that and more. It lets you say exactly how you’re feeling then it lets you say why you’re feeling that way, then I lets you title and save that as a journal update. And if just expressing feelings and emotions I ain’t enough, it also allowed you to add on with whatever you want to add. You can tell what happened that day. There’s no word limit so it’s easy to a lot off of your chest.

This app however does have its rough patches. Whenever you sign out, it save all of your progress, but it doesn’t save the settings changes. So if you have it in dark mode, when you sign out and then back in again it will be back in the default light mode. And the premium. The premium is how the app creators make their money. Yes it is a little limiting as to what you can and cannot do but I feel as if I can get plenty done even with the premium. The premium locks the extra stuff that you can do on the app. So if you feel angry because you think you’re not getting all of the app, you’re just wanting extra stuff when really all you need is the plain app it’s self.

Whenever the premium screen comes up it can be pretty confusing as to where the x is to get out of it. Just scroll down and you’ll see a No Thanks. Press that and it’ll take you out of the premium page.

I hope this review helped you. It’s the second one I’ve written actually.

Reflectly - Journal & AI Diary,iOS,1241229134,6704818829,Canada,3.16.0,4,2020-12-01,its_ava_j my insta,Hmm...,This is an awesome app but you have to pay for the better version. I like to use this to let things go and leave personal notes on what happened that day. My favourite part is that you can activate Touch ID which means no one can gat in if they do not have your finger print. My “ love “ life is complicated with ups and downs but this helps to release the tension of keeping them in. This app is great in the way that you can add daily reflections on how you feel and things that happened. You can also add images of anything in your camera roll which is great. Overall I love the app and it is good for your deepest darkest secrets. But remember you have to pay for extra things. Hopefully this helps with the thought process of downloading this app. ENJOY,,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2068701044/reply,"[""Camera & Photos"", ""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Frequency"", ""Pricing"", ""Touch ID"", ""Update"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

I downloaded this app and the features seemed great, however, everything went very wrong when I purchased it.

Next, none of the features were unlocked for me when I purchased the app i.e. it continued to ask me to purchase the app even after I did, and I wasn’t able to use any of the features I purchased. Lastly, I tried to contact support, which was a total joke. It directs you to contact support via Facebook messenger and when I did, I received no response. That’s right, there was zero response from the support team. So, now I’m out 60 bucks, can’t use the app, and support is virtually nonexistent. To say I’m extremely dissatisfied is to put it lightly.

It’s a wonderful part of my nighttime routine that I always look forward to! As a person who is known for worrying, this app is amazing with its quotes, and being able to share how you are feeling, and what made you feel that way. You probably are thinking, “If they like the app so much, why five stars instead of four?” Well, there is one thing. Some features like viewing average mood, more quotes, and some daily motivation can only be used if you by premium. I think that at least some of the stuff should be free. Granted, I honestly forgot the price of it and I don’t have it, but I think a few of the features should be free, or maybe a lower cost.

It’s made me feel good tracking my progress and it feels like even though it’s just an app, someone actually cares to check up on me. 

But I was just wondering if you’d be able to add more options where you select the activities that have made you feel good/bad that day. There’s only 10, and majority of the time none of those things impact me much. But I have to click something, otherwise it won’t let me complete it and move onto the next step. May I suggest something like involving just that person emotions and brain? Instead of it just being things like “school, family, food, health, work, friends, relationships, etc.”. I just feel like a lot of people rely on themselves for happiness, or they make themselves feel upset or angry. This is just what I think; but it would be good if you have more options to why we are feeling the way we are.

1. I could chose a picture for each day. Currently, you have to do it during that day so if you have a picture that fits something from a few days ago, it’s gonna show up on today.
2. It used to ask me a question like “who’s one person you look up to” or something like that. I liked it because it would make me think more than what happened today. If I want that again, I’m gonna have to pay money for it.

Besides that, it’s a pretty good app",,,neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2045316428/reply,"[""Camera & Photos"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users""]",[],[]

Also have to take a star off for customer service. I tried to find somewhere to speak with someone about it and all I could find was messaging on Facebook Messenger that looked like it was an automated chat that wouldn’t even respond to me.

We shouldn’t need to pay to get stats or daily check ins. It’s so frustrating. I understand they need to make money but do so in a different way. I was excited to get my stats today just to see I need premium for them. I’m young and can’t pay for a stupid premium on a MENTAL HEALTH app. Some younger ppl use this because we can’t see a therapist or something and we can’t even get updated on our own health from a highly rated app. It’s extremely frustrating and I won’t be keeping this app. Mental health is more important than your company making money. Get over yourself and let us keep track of ourselves and get quote on quote “38% happier” which is probably a lie. So without premium the app is pointless.

I may have considered it if it were a one time thing but that’s a lot of money to spend on an app when I can get a regular journal and do almost the exact same thing, although it’s not as portable, for like $5.00. I get that you have to do that to keep the app add free, but I would rather experience the full app with a couple adds rather than not getting the whole experience. I got this app because of all the features that were advertised but I can’t access them all.

This is great for those who can’t put their own thoughts together on a bad day.

I do think their should be a few more options for the mood check/ins. The moods should have two more Ex: meh, and kinda good. And the reasons page should have a few more options, including “other”.

I would also recommend adding at least one more specification, or give the option to.

That’s all I’ve got to say. I love the app, and I’m interested to see features that may be added in the future!",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2039729481/reply,"[""Use cases""]",[],[]

Because I’m a teenager constantly struggling to deal with the world we live  in and I’m dealing with depression so this app looked great. When I downloaded it I was so excited but when I saw that I would have to pay money for it that made me mad. An app that supposed to help with mental health should not cost $60 a year to use. Something like this needs to be free. I personally think it’s sick to make an app so perfect and so helpful for the ones in need and yet make it cost money. I can’t afford things like this as a teenager. This is sick and needs to fixed.,,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2041352740/reply,"[""Advertising"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Pricing"", ""Customer Support""]",[],[]

Reflectly - Journal & AI Diary,iOS,1241229134,6630574719,USA,3.13.0,2,2020-11-10,EPArrow,"Great concept, poor execution.","I downloaded this app because I love the idea of journaling and reflecting for the sake of bettering my own (and others) mental health, as well as for an assignment in my Abnormal Psychology course at my university. When I first started it, the user interface was very easy to understand and very aesthetically pleasing. Although I became very disappointed to find that almost every main feature of the app can’t be accessed without a monthly subscription. At first glance, it doesn’t seem like it has many restricted features. As I used it more and gained “access” to my stats, I was sorely disappointed that I can’t even look at the trends of my moods and feelings throughout the time using the app without paying money. I think this app has a lot of potential and is a great concept but if you’re looking for a way to reflect and evaluate your own mood, I suggest buying a cheap notebook from the store and writing in it and looking back at what you wrote after a specified amount of time rather than paying a monthly subscription for essentially the same function, but with more statistics and numbers. Or even better, you might as well go and get a real therapist for the kind of money they’re asking for. 300 dollars for a lifetime subscription is ridiculous for something that offers so little, with no human communication or contact. 

What this app does do good with: I do appreciate the motivational quotes that you can endlessly scroll through, but this is not a selling point for the app whatsoever. Additionally, I think the main feature (mood check in) is very good. The mood check ins are a great starting point for reflection on mental health as reflection and self-awareness are typically key-roles when trying to identify things like mood disorders and worries. This app also does a fantastic job of monetizing people’s mental health, specifically their poor mental health, which can be seen as a good and a bad thing depending on who you are. 

Overall, my search for a quality mood reflection and journaling app does not end here. I would say this app could be so much greater and much more versatile if the only free function available wasn’t “what’s your mood today?”. I don’t believe that is a truly efficient way to help a person or yourself when there are tons of better and cheaper ways to go towards that’ll be more beneficial in both the short and long term. Also, At the end of the day, nothing beats human connection when it comes to improving and reflecting on your day and how you feel.",,,negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2036241024/reply,"[""Bugs"", ""Complexity"", ""Connectivity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Dissatisfied users"", ""Gaming"", ""Payment"", ""Pricing"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

i got this app a few days ago and i’m already hooked. so far, it’s done so much better than any other diary apps to keep me consistently checking in on my moods. it’s also super beneficial because it helps me keep track of what makes me happy, and what brings me down.

the statistics, quotes, and other additional features are also super helpful. it’s not pressurizing and doesn’t send you annoying notifications every second to come check in.

i also purchased the premium version. i really like it because the reflections help me look back on my life and get a better perspective on things.

all in all, it’s just a great app, and i can’t wait to see more! 100% recommend it to anyone. 💕",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2038082097/reply,"[""Notifications & Alerts"", ""Performance"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Update""]",[],[]

Reflectly - Journal & AI Diary,iOS,1241229134,6611909014,USA,3.12.0,5,2020-11-05,Maeghan G.,Easy to use even when your motivation is at its lowest.,"The app is very easy to navigate and has a soothing, calm appearance to it. I love how you can make it your own, but also that it’s organized and structured enough to guide you through without feeling the need to write an essay every day. It’s super helpful to be able to track your moods because it helps you identify triggers to negative emotions and thoughts that you might never have noticed otherwise. I love the quotes and the calming art behind them too. When my depression is at its worst and I can’t get off of the couch or out of bed, it’s one thing I can do to motivate me to take that next step forward. Great app all around!

Update - I’ve read some reviews where people are complaining about the price. While I totally understand, you need to remember that it costs a lot of money to develop, update, and just run an app. The people who are working every day to keep the app the best it can be (and who developed it in the first place) need money too! The fact that they’ve avoided needing ads to fund the app for so long tells you all you need to know about how much they care for their consumers. If you don’t have insurance, it can cost $75 just to see a counselor for one appointment. While this isn’t the same as having a counselor, it provides an invaluable amount of mental health benefits in a setting that’s totally personal, private, and incredibly convenient. I can’t call my counselor during my 30 minute lunch break in a 10 hour work day, but I can certainly write a quick entry about how stressed I am, and read quotes that motivate me to keep pushing and stay positive! Simply put, I think it’s kind of unrealistic/unfair to complain about a price that’s honestly very reasonable for all the app has to offer. Ads are my biggest app turn-off all around, so kudos to the Reflectly team for doing the best they can to put food on their own tables and help thousands of people stay alive and stay well at the same time!",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2029234723/reply,"[""Advertising"", ""Complexity"", ""Design & UX"", ""Feature Requests"", ""Frequency"", ""Performance"", ""Privacy"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Customer Support"", ""Use cases""]",[],[]

I love the inspirational quotes every morning but I really wish I didn’t have to pay monthly for it! I don’t exactly have the money to do so but I’d love to use the features! I think it’s a great app but it was nice to do the daily reflection and not have to pay for it, but when they removed that and added it to the premium features it kinda made me lose interest in the app, I used to use it daily until they made almost everything a membership only feature, but if you have an extra $20 to spend every year then go for it! The only features you’ll have with the free version is the ability to do a mood check-in, add photos (which I haven’t done yet) and see the inspirational quotes.",,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1526549-reflectly-journal-ai-diary/reviews/2026499637/reply,"[""Camera & Photos"", ""Design & UX"", ""Frequency"", ""Pricing"", ""Satisfied users"", ""Update""]",[],[]
